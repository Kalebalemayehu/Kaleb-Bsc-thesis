However, soil moisture is affected by various soil, crop, and meteorological factors, and it is difficult to establish ideal mathematical models for moisture prediction. We investigated various machine learning techniques for predicting soil moisture in the Red River Valley of the North (RRVN). Specifically, the evaluated machine learning techniques included classification and regression trees (CART), random forest regression (RFR), boosted regression trees (BRT), multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of these machine learning techniques and evaluate the importance of predictor variables. The RFR and BRT algorithms performed the best, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of &lt;0.040 m3 m−3 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.045 and 0.048 m3 m−3, respectively. Similarly, RFR, SVR, and BRT showed high correlations (r2 of 0.72, 0.65 and 0.67 respectively) between predicted and measured soil moisture. The CART, RFR, and BRT models showed that soil moisture at nearby weather stations had the highest relative influence on moisture prediction, followed by 4-day cumulative rainfall and PET, subsequently followed by bulk density and Ksat. © 2021 by the authors.

Since many restaurants moved online and joined FDSs such as Uber Eats, Menulog, and Deliveroo, customer reviews on internet platforms have become a valuable source of information about a company’s performance. FDS organisations strive to collect customer complaints and effectively utilise the information to identify improvements needed to enhance customer satisfaction. However, only a few customer opinions are addressed because of the large amount of customer feedback data and lack of customer service consultants. Organisations can use artificial intelligence (AI) instead of relying on customer service experts and find solutions on their own to save money as opposed to reading each review. Based on the literature, deep learning (DL) methods have shown remarkable results in obtaining better accuracy when working with large datasets in other domains, but lack explainability in their model. Rapid research on explainable AI (XAI) to explain predictions made by opaque models looks promising but remains to be explored in the FDS domain. This study conducted a sentiment analysis by comparing simple and hybrid DL techniques (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN) in the FDS domain and explained the predictions using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The DL models were trained and tested on the customer review dataset extracted from the ProductReview website. Results showed that the LSTM, Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN models achieved an accuracy of 96.07%, 95.85% and 96.33%, respectively. The model should exhibit fewer false negatives because FDS organisations aim to identify and address each and every customer complaint. The LSTM model was chosen over the other two DL models, Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN, due to its lower rate of false negatives. XAI techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, revealed the feature contribution of the words used towards positive and negative sentiments, which were used to validate the model. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; explainable AI; food delivery service; LIME; sentiment analysis; SHapley",

With all restaurants going online and bringing FDSs onboard, such as UberEATS, Menulog or Deliveroo, customer reviews on online platforms have become an important source of information about the company’s performance. FDS organisations aim to gather complaints from customer feedback and effectively use the data to determine the areas for improvement to enhance customer satisfaction. This work aimed to review machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to predict customer sentiments in the FDS domain. A literature review revealed the wide usage of lexicon-based and ML techniques for predicting sentiments through customer reviews in FDS. However, limited studies applying DL techniques were found due to the lack of the model interpretability and explainability of the decisions made. The key findings of this systematic review are as follows: 77% of the models are non-interpretable in nature, and organisations can argue for the explainability and trust in the system. DL models in other domains perform well in terms of accuracy but lack explainability, which can be achieved with XAI implementation. Future research should focus on implementing DL models for sentiment analysis in the FDS domain and incorporating XAI techniques to bring out the explainability of the models. © 2022 by the authors.

This study evaluates the potential for machine learning (ML) approaches to predict soil GHG emissions without the biogeochemical expertise that is required to use many current models for simulating soil GHGs. There are ample data from field measurements now publicly available to test new modeling approaches. The objective of this paper was to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models using field data (soil temperature, soil moisture, soil classification, crop type, fertilization type, and air temperature) available in the Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network (GRACEnet) database to simulate soil CO2 fluxes with different fertilization methods. Four machine learning algorithms—K nearest neighbor regression (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) regression, and gradient boosted (GB) regression—were used to develop the models. The GB regression model out-performed all the other models on the training dataset with R2 = 0.88, MAE = 2177.89 g C ha−1 day−1, and RMSE 4405.43 g C ha−1 day−1 . However, the RF and GB regression models both performed optimally on the unseen test dataset with R2 = 0.82. Machine learning tools were useful for developing predictors based on soil classification, soil temperature and air temperature when a large database like GRACEnet is available, but these were not highly predictive variables in correlation analysis. This study demonstrates the suitability of using tree-based ML algorithms for predictive modeling of CO2 fluxes, but no biogeochemical processes can be described with such models. © 2022 by the authors.

This IoT is getting outstandingly universal and ubiquitous in today's society with a transformative and constructive impact on different application domains like smart and sustainable living, smart healthcare, smart agriculture, smart cities, manufacturing, and more. Consequently, there has been escalating quantitative expansion in the devices connected to IoT leading to the generation of massive volumes of data, depicting a perfect overlap of big data generation with that of IoT. These voluminous data are totally useless without any proper analytic procedure and is much more than humans will be able to process and analyze. In addition to being huge in terms of size and volume, the big data generated by IoT are of highly veracious and variable nature with a variety of data forms and quality. Further, it is highly distinguished by its velocity in terms of creation, time, processing, location dependency, and accessibility. As a result, smart analysis of such data for obtaining valuable insights is a challenging task. Intelligent data analytics is an important prerequisite to maximize the business value of IoT and realize its hyped market potential. Machine learning has the power to handle different challenges associated with IoT data and can be deployed effectively as they require minimal human intervention. In this chapter, different machine learning algorithms will be discussed along with their potential and challenges for IoT data analytics. The central goal of this chapter is to present a taxonomy of various machine learning approaches and demonstrate the implementation of different techniques so as to do higher level analysis using IoT data. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The quantification of its effect is important for retailers, as cannibalisation can lead to wasted food and lost profits. The performance of promotions is ultimately dependent on their features but also on the characteristics of the stores, i.e. type of store or its location. Generally speaking, there is no homogeneous response to a promotion, and by extension to sales cannibalisation. Accordingly, in this paper we describe a framework to analyse the effects of cannibalisation due to individual promotions based on the relationship amongst their sales. The novelty of our work resides in understanding cannibalisation as a causal effect where the increase in sales of the promoted product is partly due to the decrease in sales of the non-promoted one. As such, we propose to use causal inference to measure the impact of cannibalisation due to promotions. Our method reviews each product that has been on promotion, searching for potential cannibals, given by products whose promotion have resulted in large sales uplifts, and for the fall-outs, given by those products experiencing a reduction in sales due to the cannibals. Then each cannibal-victim pair is analysed with Causal Impact, a time-series method which allows one to infer the causal effect of an intervention. We demonstrate the practical application of detecting cannibalisation on vast datasets of promotions within several stores and their many departments. To provide with an overview of the cannibalisation for entire departments and not simply for individual products, we build a directed graph. This is both unique and of utmost value to store managers and marketing teams. Additionally, we discuss in the Appendix the application of explainable forecasting to cannibalisation on a surrogate model. © 2013 IEEE.","Causal inference; interpretable machine learning (iML); retail promotions; sales cannibalization; supply chain","Chemical contamination; Directed graphs; Human resource management; Causal inferences; Knock-on effect; Large sales; Marketing team; Surrogate model; Time series method; Sales"

The traditional rice almanac used astronomical and climate factors to estimate yield response. However, this research integrated meteorological, agro-chemical, and soil physiographic factors for yield response prediction. Besides, the impact of those factors on the production of three major rice ecotypes has also been studied in this research. Moreover, this study found a different set of those factors with respect to the yield response of different rice ecotypes. Machine learning algorithms named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used for predicting the yield response. The SVR shows better results than XGBoost for predicting the yield of the Aus rice ecotype, whereas XGBoost performs better for forecasting the yield of the Aman and Boro rice ecotypes. The result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of three different ecotypes are in between 9.38% and 24.37% and that of R-squared values are between 89.74% and 99.13% on two different machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the explainability of the models is also shown in this study with the help of the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). © 2022 Md.

However, plant diseases are the most significant impediment to the production and quality of food. The identification of plant diseases at an early stage is crucial for global health and wellbeing. The traditional diagnosis process involves visual assessment of an individual plant by a pathologist through on-site visits. However, manual examination for crop diseases is restricted because of less accuracy and the small accessibility of human resources. To tackle such issues, there is a demand to design automated approaches capable of efficiently detecting and categorizing numerous plant diseases. Precise identification and classification of plant diseases is a tedious job due because of the occurrence of low-intensity information in the image background and foreground, the huge color resemblance in the healthy and diseased plant areas, the occurrence of noise in the samples, and changes in the position, chrominance, structure, and size of plant leaves. To tackle the above-mentioned problems, we have introduced a robust plant disease classification system by introducing a Custom CenterNet framework with DenseNet-77 as a base network. The presented method follows three steps. In the first step, annotations are developed to get the region of interest. Secondly, an improved CenterNet is introduced in which DenseNet-77 is proposed for deep keypoints extraction. Finally, the one-stage detector CenterNet is used to detect and categorize several plant diseases. To conduct the performance analysis, we have used the PlantVillage Kaggle database, which is the standard dataset for plant diseases and challenges in terms of intensity variations, color changes, and differences found in the shapes and sizes of leaves. Both the qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that the presented method is more proficient and reliable to identify and classify plant diseases than other latest approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; CenterNet; Deep learning; DenseNet; Plant disease",

In this paper, we show how this can be now achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a large Mid-Infrared (MIR) soil spectral library (40,000 samples with Kex determined with 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7), compiled by the National Soil Survey Center of the United States Department of Agriculture. Using Partial Least Squares Regression as a baseline, we found that our implemented CNN leads to a significantly higher prediction performance of Kex when a large amount of data is available (10000), increasing the coefficient of determination from 0.64 to 0.79, and reducing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error from 135% to 31%. Furthermore, in order to provide end-users with required interpretive keys, we implemented the GradientShap algorithm to identify the spectral regions considered important by the model for predicting Kex. Used in the context of the implemented CNN on various Soil Taxonomy Orders, it allowed (i) to relate the important spectral features to domain knowledge and (ii) to demonstrate that including all Soil Taxonomy Orders in CNN-based modeling is beneficial as spectral features learned can be reused across different, sometimes underrepresented orders. © 2022 The Authors","Agriculture; Convolutional neural network; High-throughput soil characterization; Interpretability; Machine learning; Nuclear emergency response; Remediation",

Many factors influence crop yield, such as soil, amount of water, climate, and genotype. Determining factors that significantly influence yield prediction and identify the most appropriate predictive methods are important in yield management. It is critical to consider and study the combination of different crop factors and their impact on the yield. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to use advanced data analytic techniques to precisely predict the soybean crop yields, (2) to identify the most influential features that impact soybean predictions, (3) to illustrate the ability of Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) sub-systems, which are self-organizing, self-learning, and data-driven, by using the recently developed Autonomous Learning Multiple-Model First-order (ALMMo-1) system, and (4) to compare the performance with other well-known methods. The ALMMo-1 system is a transparent model, which stakeholders can easily read and interpret. The model is a data-driven and composed of prototypes selected from the actual data. Many factors affect the yield, and data clouds can be formed in the feature/data space based on the data density. The data cloud is the key to the IF part of FRB sub-systems, while the THEN part (the consequences of the IF condition) illustrates the yield prediction in the form of a linear regression model, which consists of the yield features or factors. In addition, the model can determine the most influential features of the yield prediction online. The model shows an excellent prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0883, and Non-Dimensional Error Index (NDEI) of 0.0611, which is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous Learning; Fuzzy Rule-Based; Linear regression; Multi-Modal; Soybean yield prediction","Advanced Analytics; Crops; Data Analytics; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Linear regression; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Autonomous learning; Fuzzy rule based; Linear regression models; Multi-modal; Root mean square errors; Self-learning models; State-of-the-art methods; Yield prediction; Learning systems"

This ecosystem is characterized by towering mountains, cold weather, tall trees such as pine, and dwarfed plants. Although the combination of optical and radar imagery has shown promise in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, only a handful of studies have attempted to study the dynamics of land changes in tropical montasne forests by combining the two. In this study, we examined the usage of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) and their fusion as input for LULC mapping with three modeling classifiers: traditional (maximum likelihood classification - MLC), machine learning techniques (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and kd-tree nearest neighbor), and a deep learning approach (U-Net) in a TMF in the Philippines. Also, the deforestation was characterized in terms of proximity and topographic factors. The findings revealed that the combination of S-1 and S-2 provides LULC with high accuracy of image classification. In binary classification, traditional MLC supersedes other classifiers in correctly classifying the pixels of the input imagery (average overall accuracy (OA) = 95.22; Kappa index (KI) = 90.39). Random Forest (RF) stands out in machine learning classifiers (average OA = 94.49; KI = 88.8). However, U-Net deep learning loses in binary classification but proven more robust when LULC were classified into six complex classes with an OA of 86.77 and KI of 78.89. In addition, using deep learning modeling for LULC mapping of the research site, it was determined that from 2015 to early 2022, 417.93 km2 of the study area had been deforested. Further, this research reveals that the greater the proximity of a forest to a human settlement or agricultural zone, the greater the likelihood that it will be cleared for human habitation or agriculture. Deforestation also occurred in rural locations, far from roads and bodies of water. This analysis also supports the hypothesis that deforestation can occur even in high-elevation areas. The results of this study can be utilized by policy and law makers in order to better communicate the critical nature of implementing evidence- and science-based policies to strengthen protections, as well as developing conservation and management plan for tropical montane forests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Optical; Radar; Tropical montane forest; U-Net",

The slight variance among different kinds of insects in appearance makes it hard for human experts to recognize. It is increasingly imperative to finely recognize specific insects by employing machine learning methods. In this study, we proposed a feature fusion network to synthesize feature presentations in different backbone models. Firstly, we employed one CNN-based backbone ResNet, and two attention-based backbones Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer to localize the important regions of insect images with Grad-CAM. During this process, we designed new architectures for these two Transformers to enable Grad-CAM to be applicable in such attention-based models. Then we further proposed an attention-selection mechanism to reconstruct the attention area by delicately integrating the important regions, enabling these partial but key expressions to complement each other. We only need part of the image scope that represents the most crucial decision-making information for insect recognition. We randomly selected 20 species of insects from the IP102 dataset and then adopted all 102 kinds of insects to test the classification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other advanced CNN-based models. More importantly, our attention-selection mechanism demonstrates good robustness to augmented images. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"article; attention; controlled study; decision making; human; insect; nonhuman; randomized controlled trial; residual neural network; vision; agriculture; animal; ecology; insect; machine learning; power supply; Agriculture; Animals; Ecology; Electric Power Supplies; Humans; Insecta; Machine Learning"

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a datadriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC. © 2021 by the authors.

The opportunity to apply these potentially faster, more accurate, and cost-effective approaches remains an important goal to facilitate their incorporation into regulatory use. However, without a clear strategy to evaluate emerging technologies rapidly and appropriately, the value of these efforts may go unrecognized or may take longer. It is important for the regulatory science field to keep up with the research in these technically advanced areas and to understand the science behind these new approaches. The regulatory field must understand the critical quality attributes of these novel approaches and learn from each other's experience so that workforces can be trained to prepare for emerging global regulatory challenges. Moreover, it is essential that the regulatory community must work with the technology developers to harness collective capabilities towards developing a strategy for evaluation of these new and novel assessment tools. © 2021 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","bioimaging; bioinformatics; biomarkers; Emerging technologies; regulatory science; risk assessment","biological marker; domoic acid; Ebola vaccine; gadodiamide; gadoxetic acid; glyphosate; hexachlorophene; kainic acid; methamphetamine; neutralizing antibody; nonnutritive sweetener; pyrithiamine; saccharin; sweetening agent; transcriptome; trastuzumab; anaphylaxis; antibiotic resistance; anxiety; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automation; bacterial growth; bioinformatics; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; caudate nucleus; cell differentiation; computer assisted tomography; computer simulation; decision making; decision tree; dentate nucleus; drug surveillance program; echocardiography; elastography; electronic health record; environmental health; feces microflora; gene expression; health care personnel; health care utilization; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; herd immunity; high throughput screening; histopathology; human; immune response; immunohistochemistry; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; LD50; learning algorithm; lifestyle modification; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; liver toxicity; machine learning; magnetic resonance elastography; mass cytometry; mass spectrometry; mechanical hyperalgesia; metabolomics; metagenomics; microbial community; microbiome; mobile application; mutagenicity; nanotechnology; natural language processing; nervous system inflammation; neurotoxicity; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteoarthritis; personalized medicine; phenotype; point of care testing; propensity score; protein expression; proteomics; quantitative structure activity relation; Review; risk assessment; transcriptomics; tumor microenvironment; whole genome sequencing; workforce; computer simulation; medical research; Biomedical Research; Computer Simulation; Humans"

A critical issue in T1D patients is the managing of Postprandial Glucose Response (PGR), through the dosing of the insulin bolus to inject before meals. The Artificial Pancreas (AP), combining autonomous insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring, is a promising solution. However, state-of-the-art APs require several information for bolus delivery, such as the estimated carbohydrate intake over the meals. This is mainly related to the limited knowledge of the determinants of PGR. Although meal carbohydrates are mostly considered as the major factor into, uencing PGR, other food components play a relevant role in PGRs, and thus, should be taken into account. Based on these considerations, a study to determine the effect of nutritional factors (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fibers, and energy intake) in the short and middle term on Blood Glucose Levels (BGLs) prediction was conducted by Machine Learning (ML) methods. A ML model able to predict the BGLs after 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes from the meal leveraging on insulin doses, blood glucose, and nutritional factors in T1D patients on AP systems was implemented. More specifically, to investigate the impact of the nutritional factors on the model predictions, a Feed-Forward Neural Network, was fed with several dispositions of BGLs, insulin, and nutritional factors. Both public and self-produced data were used to validate the proposal. The results suggest that patient-specific information about nutritional factors can be significant for middle term postprandial BGLs predictions. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; artificial pancreas; blood glucose; health 40; machine learning; neural networks; nutritional factors; patient monitoring; postprandial glucose response; prediction model; statistical attributes; type 1 diabetes","Artificial organs; Blood; Feedforward neural networks; Glucose; Insulin; Machine learning; Patient monitoring; Artificial pancreas; Blood glucose; Glucose response; Health 40; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Nutritional factors; Postprandial glucose response; Prediction modelling; Statistical attribute; Type 1 diabetes; Forecasting"

The proposed approach can be applied to develop indicator systems and create methodological platforms and models necessary to obtain more accurate estimates. In comparison with the traditional regression model, this method uses computer vision technology to gather additional data. Statistical hypothesis testing confirmed the significance of satellite photographs of fields for improving the accuracy of crop yield forecasting models. Traditional econometric tools were compared with various neural networks in order to discover the optimal model. The proposed tools were tested using data from 100 agricultural fields located in municipalities of 43 Russian regions, selected in proportion to the volume of crop production in this region. The conducted analysis showed the advantage of the mixed data neural network in comparison with other neural (multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network) and regression models. In conditions of uncertainty and a large amount of data, the mixed data neural network can help obtain more accurate estimates. Additionally, while environmental factors have different effects on crop yields, they must be considered along with socio-economic characteristics. The use of new models and data types differing from table information can significantly improve the forecasting accuracy and interpretation. The analysis results can be used for examining and monitoring agricultural production in regional municipalities, determining farm resource requirements, as well as for creating sectoral and comprehensive projects and programmes for the development of the agricultural industry. © 2022 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The current study proposes approaches to make the network to learn meaningful features. In addition, a set of interpretability- and explanation-based evaluation strategies are proposed to evaluate the DL models. Adversarial variational encoding along with constraints to regulate latent representations and embed label information are employed to learn interpretable manifold. The proposed architecture, called interpretable adversarial encoding network (IAENet), significantly improves the results compared to other main existing DL models. The proposed IAENet learns the features which are essential in distinguishing the different classes thereby improving the interpretability of the model. The explanations for the different models are generated through analysis of the concepts learned by each model using activation maximization. Besides, the relevance assigned by the model to input features is also estimated using the layer-wise relevance propagation approach. Experiments on the phenological curve-based crop classification illustrate that IAENet learn relevant features (giving importance to the non-rainy season) to distinguish different irrigation schemes. The performance can be attributed to the learned interpretable manifold, and the refinement of architectural units and convolutions considering the point-nature and irregular sampling of the input data. Experiments on learning crop-specific features from multispectral images for crop-type classification indicate that IAENet learns red and green edge features crucial in distinguishing the studied crops. The improvement in interpretability of the DL models is found to reduce the sensitivity toward network parameters. The proposed evaluation measures facilitate ascertaining the physical significance of the learned manifold. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Crop-specific features; Deep learning; Interpretability; Phenological curves; VENµS","Activation analysis; Classification (of information); Data handling; Deep learning; Encoding (symbols); Irrigation; Signal encoding; Crop classification; Crop-specific feature; Deep learning; Earth observation data; Interpretability; Irrigation schemes; Learn+; Learning models; Phenological curve; VENµS; Crops"

The current study explores the use of capsules, a group of neurons having an activation vector, to learn the characteristic features of the phenological curves. In addition, joint optimization of denoising and classification is adopted to improve the generalizability of the approach and to make it resilient to noise. The proposed approach employs reconstruction loss as a regularizer for classification, whereas the crop-type label is used as prior information for denoising. The activity vector of the class capsule is applied to sample the latent space conditioned on the cell state of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that integrates the sequences of the phenological events. Learning of significant phenological characteristics is facilitated by adversarial variational encoding in conjunction with constraints to regulate latent representations and embed label information. The proposed architecture, called the variational capsule network (VCapsNet), significantly improves the classification and denoising results. The performance of VCapsNet can be attributed to the suitable modeling of phenological events and the resilience to outliers and noise. The maxpooling-based capsule implementation yields better results, particularly with limited training samples, compared to the conventional implementations. In addition to the confusion matrix-based accuracy measures, this study illustrates the use of interpretability-based evaluation measures. Moreover, the proposed approach is less sensitive to noise and yields good results, even at shallower depths, compared to the main existing approaches. The performance of VCapsNet in accurately classifying wheat and barley crops indicates that the approach addresses the issues in crop-type classification. The approach is generic and effectively models the crop-specific phenological features and events. The interpretability-based evaluation measures further indicate that the approach successfully identifies the crop transitions, in addition to the planting, heading, and harvesting dates. Due to its effectiveness in crop-type classification, the proposed approach is applicable to acreage estimation and other applications in different scales. © 2021 by the authors.

Long-term conditions with significant disease heterogeneity comprise large portions of the routine work performed by paediatricians. Improving outcomes through discovery of disease and treatment prediction models, alongside novel subgroup clustering of patients, are some of the areas in which machine learning holds significant promise. While artificial intelligence has percolated into routine use in our day to day lives through advertising algorithms, song or movie selections and sifting of spam emails, the ability of machine learning to utilise highly complex and dimensional data has not yet reached its full potential in healthcare. In this review article, we discuss some of the foundations of machine learning, including some of the basic algorithms. We emphasise the importance of correct utilisation of machine learning, including adequate data preparation and external validation.

Undoubtedly the success of the system would be impacted on crop productivity, where failure would impact severely.

Research for developing models of flood predictions has been ongoing for the past few years. These models are proposed and built-in proportion for risk reduction, policy proposition, loss of human lives, and property damages associated with floods. However, flood status prediction is a complex process and demands extensive analyses on the factors leading to the occurrence of flooding. Consequently, this research proposes an Internet of Things-based flood status prediction (IoT-FSP) model that is used to facilitate the prediction of the rivers flood situation. The IoT-FSP model applies the Internet of Things architecture to facilitate the flood data acquisition process and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are Decision Tree (DT), Decision Jungle, and Random Forest, for the flood prediction process. The IoT-FSP model is implemented in MATLAB and Simulink as development platforms. The results show that the IoT-FSP model successfully performs the data acquisition and prediction tasks and achieves an average accuracy of 85.72% for the three-fold cross-validation results. The research finding shows that the DT scores the highest accuracy of 93.22%, precision of 92.85, and recall of 92.81 among the three ML algorithms. The ability of the ML algorithm to handle multivariate outputs of 13 different flood textual statuses provides the means of manifesting explainable artificial intelligence and enables the IoT-FSP model to act as an early warning and flood monitoring system. © 2022 Firas Mohammed Aswad et al., published by De Gruyter.","explainable artificial intelligence; flood prediction; Internet of Things; machine learning; multivariate classification","Data acquisition; Decision trees; Disasters; Floods; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Agriculture industries; Explainable artificial intelligence; Flood prediction; Human being; Machine learning algorithms; Multivariate classification; Natural disasters; Prediction modelling; Risks reduction; Tree-based; Internet of things"

Due to the requirements of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters. The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches. We have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks. In addition, this research helps to create friendlier environments and efficient agricultural productions for the migration of people to the cities. © 2020 by the authors.

Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) based district-wise wheat yield dataset was also used with satellite variables to develop the historical wheat yield model based on the multiple regression analysis. Spatially, higher, lower, and lower to moderate wheat yields are observed in the western and northwest parts, southern and southeast parts, and lower-middle to the lower right parts of the state respectively throughout the study years. Remarkably, the years 2017,2018, and 2019 witnessed higher yields, while 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2015 witnessed lower yield. The developed wheat yield models performed well, as R2 values were observed between 0.3 and 0.76 between the satellite-derived and DES-based district-wise mean yield. The mean absolute error was found to be considerable and ranged between 0.22 and 1.7 t/ha during the study years. The adopted methodology can be used across the different parts of the globe at the local to country scale for a quantitative crop yield depiction and mapping at the satellite pixel level.

After collecting enough measurements, the DT firstly predicts the physical twin performance during training and, in case of non-optimal result, it suggests modifications in the athlete's behavior. The athlete's team is integrated into SmartFit, a software framework for supporting trainers and coaches in monitoring and manage athletes' fitness activity and results. Through IoT sensors embedded in wearable devices and applications for manual logging (e.g. mood, food income), SmartFit continuously captures measurements, initially treated as the dynamic data describing the current physical twins' status. Dynamic data allows adapting each DT's status and triggering the DT's predictions and suggestions. The analyzed measurements are stored as the historical data, further processed by the DT to update (increase) its knowledge and ability to provide reliable predictions. Results show that, thanks to the team of DTs, SmartFit computes trustable predictions of the physical twins' conditions and produces understandable suggestions which can be used by trainers to trigger optimization actions in the athletes' behavior.

Recently, on-and off-combine harvester sensors have been developed for creating spatial GPC layers. The quality of these GPC layers, as measured by the coefficient of determination (R2 ) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the relationship between measured and predicted GPC, is affected by different sensing characteristics. The objectives of this synthesis analysis were to (i) contrast GPC prediction R2 and RMSE for different sensor types (on-combine, off-combine proximal and remote); (ii) contrast and discuss the best spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions and features, and the best statistical approach for off-combine sensors; and (iii) review current technology limitations and provide future directions for spatial GPC research and application. On-combine sensors were more accurate than remote sensors in predicting GPC, yet with similar precision. The most optimal conditions for creating reliable GPC predictions from off-combine sensors were sensing near anthesis using multiple spectral features that include the blue and green bands, and that are analyzed by complex statistical approaches. We discussed sensor choice in regard to previously identified uses of a GPC layer, and further proposed new uses with remote sensors including same season fertilizer management for increased GPC, and in advance segregated harvest planning related to field prioritization and farm infrastructure. Limitations of the GPC literature were identified and future directions for GPC research were proposed as (i) performing GPC predictive studies on a larger variety of crops and water regimes; (ii) reporting proper GPC ground-truth calibrations; (iii) conducting proper model training, validation, and testing; (iv) reporting model fit metrics that express greater concordance with the ideal predictive model; and (v) implementing and benchmarking one or more uses for a GPC layer. © 2021 by the authors.

Dementia is not a mere individual health issue, since its interference with the ability to carry out daily activities entails a series of collateral problems, comprising exclusion of patients from civil rights and welfare, unpaid caregiving work, mostly performed by women, and an additional burden on the public healthcare systems. Thus, gender and wealth inequalities (both among individuals and among countries) tend to amplify the social impact of such a disease. Since at present there is no cure for dementia but only drug treatments to slow down its progress and mitigate the symptoms, it is essential to work on prevention and early diagnosis, identifying the risk factors that increase the probability of its onset. The complex and multifactorial etiology of dementia, resulting from an interplay between genetics and environmental factors, can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that follows the “One Health” guidelines of the World Health Organization. Methods: In this work, we apply methods of Artificial Intelligence and complex systems physics to investigate the possibility to predict dementia prevalence throughout world countries from a set of variables concerning individual health, food consumption, substance use and abuse, healthcare system efficiency. The analysis uses publicly available indicator values at a country level, referred to a time window of 26 years. Results: Employing methods based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and complex networks, we identify a group of lifestyle factors, mostly concerning nutrition, that contribute the most to dementia incidence prediction. Discussion: The proposed approach provides a methodological basis to develop quantitative tools for action patterns against such a disease, which involves issues deeply related with sustainable, such as good health and resposible food consumption.

The dataset presented here enables researchers to relate global air quality metrics to easy-access metadata and to explore different machine learning methods for obtaining estimates of air quality based on this metadata. AQ-Bench contains a unique collection of aggregated air quality data from the years 2010-2014 and metadata at more than 5500 air quality monitoring stations all over the world, provided by the first Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR). It focuses in particular on metrics of tropospheric ozone, which has a detrimental effect on climate, human morbidity and mortality, as well as crop yields. The purpose of this dataset is to produce estimates of various long-term ozone metrics based on time-independent local site conditions. We combine this task with a suitable evaluation metric. Baseline scores obtained from a linear regression method, a fully connected neural network and random forest are provided for reference and validation. AQ-Bench offers a low-threshold entrance for all machine learners with an interest in environmental science and for atmospheric scientists who are interested in applying machine learning techniques.

The majority of the burden of type 2 diabetes is attributed to environmental risks and modifiable risk factors such as lifestyle. The environment we live in, and changes to it, can thus contribute substantially to the prevention of type 2 diabetes at a population level. The ‘exposome’ represents the (measurable) totality of environmental, i.e. nongenetic, drivers of health and disease. The external exposome comprises aspects of the built environment, the social environment, the physico-chemical environment and the lifestyle/food environment. The internal exposome comprises measurements at the epigenetic, transcript, proteome, microbiome or metabolome level to study either the exposures directly, the imprints these exposures leave in the biological system, the potential of the body to combat environmental insults and/or the biology itself. In this review, we describe the evidence for environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes, focusing on both the general external exposome and imprints of this on the internal exposome. Studies provided established associations of air pollution, residential noise and area-level socioeconomic deprivation with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while neighbourhood walkability and green space are consistently associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. There is little or inconsistent evidence on the contribution of the food environment, other aspects of the social environment and outdoor temperature. These environmental factors are thought to affect type 2 diabetes risk mainly through mechanisms incorporating lifestyle factors such as physical activity or diet, the microbiome, inflammation or chronic stress. To further assess causality of these associations, future studies should focus on investigating the longitudinal effects of our environment (and changes to it) in relation to type 2 diabetes risk and whether these associations are explained by these proposed mechanisms.

A crucial component of food security is ensuring and maintaining safe and high-quality goods, which the supply chain process should take into due deliberation. To enhance the food supply chain, organic and wholesome food items should be encouraged. Although packaged goods are evaluated and approved by legal authorities, there is no mechanism in place for testing and assessing the market’s available supply on a regular basis. As a result, food manufacturers are compelled to provide nutritious and healthy products. In this research, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence-based faster regions with convolutional neural networks (XAI-based Faster RCNN) model to evaluate the contents of the food items through user-friendly web-based front-end design and QR code. To validate each communication token in the network, an elliptic curve integrated encrypted scheme (ECIES) based on blockchain technology is utilized. Additionally, artificial rabbit optimization (ARO) is used to register each user and assign him a key. The user will gain a deeper understanding of machine learning (ML) and AI applications using the XAI technique. An EAI-based Faster RCNN model is proposed to help digitize information about food products, rapidly retrieve the information, and discover any hidden information in the quick response (QR) code that could have impacted the safety and quality of the food. The results of the experiments indicated that the proposed method requires less response time than other existing methods with the increase of payload and users. The Shapley additive explanation is used to obtain a legal plea for the laboratory test based on the nutritional information present in the QR code. The benefits provided by ECIES-based blockchain technology assist policymakers, manufacturers, and merchants in efficient decision-making, minimizing public health hazards, and improving welfare. This paper also shows that the accuracy achieved by the proposed method reached 99.53%, with the lowest processing time. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial rabbit optimization; faster regions with convolutional neural networks; food chain supply; food production industry; secure blockchain","artificial intelligence; design; food industry; food production; food security; food supply; optimization; supply chain management"

However, improving agricultural productivity requires proper identification and minimization of diseases that degrade both the quality and quantity of the crops. The scientific community has stressed that the use of recent technologies such as deep learning, the internet of things, computer vision, etc. are vital to address various challenges in the agriculture sector. Furthermore, the use of computer vision to automatically identify diseases is growing in popularity. This paper provides a comparative analysis of six pre-trained deep learning models, namely VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and Xception, for disease detection in cucumber plants. The pre-trained models are fine-tuned using transfer learning and evaluated using different metrics such as training accuracy, testing accuracy, and the number of epochs. The results obtained demonstrate that VGG16, despite being the smallest model in terms of the number of layers, outperforms the rest of the models in all of the evaluation metrics. The VGG16 models obtain testing accuracy of 98% and training accuracy of 99.91% while being trained for 8 epochs. In addition, it is observed that models with a larger number of layers, such as ResNet50 and ResNet101, exhibit fluctuations in accuracy while training due to the execution of fairly large models on a comparatively small dataset. However, InceptionV3 and Xception, despite having a greater number of layers, perform better than ResNet models due to the presence of Inception modules which are better equipped to detect different-sized targets. The findings of this study may be utilized to optimize the best-performing models for disease classification in other plants, and the fine-tuned VGG16 model can be integrated with mobile devices for real-time disease classification. © 2018-2023, Rangsit University.","cucumber disease classification; deep learning; digital agriculture; plant disease; transfer learning",

Design/methodology/approach: The top 10 restaurants from Mumbai and Kolkata were selected based on the Conde Nast Traveller Magazine List, 2020. The study used a cross-sectional design to collect responses from 840 respondents across the two major metropolitans of India after the second wave of COVID-19 by employing a structured questionnaire. The proffered hypotheses in this study were validated using factor analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques. Findings: This research espies pivotal facilitators of CS and customers' perceived value (CPV). The results divulge that food quality (FQ) and tangibility dimensions markedly enhance CS while the FQ and digital technologies (DT) dimensions augment CPV in Indian restaurants. The study asserts that CPV acts as a partial mediator between FQ and DT on the one hand and CS on the other. In addition, perceived pandemic susceptibility (PPSU) and perceived pandemic severity (PPSE) moderate the association between CPV and CS in restaurants. Research limitations/implications: This study exemplifies the critical enablers of CS and CPV that may invigorate restaurant owners, managers and policymakers to prioritize the identified dimensions to aggrandize CS and CPV quotients.

This work combines near-infrared spectroscopy with machine-learning models for early detection of this problem. Specifically, domain adaptation is used to transfer models from spectra acquired under stationary conditions to moving samples, thereby minimizing the volume of labelled data required to collect on a production line. Two deep-learning domain-adaptation methodologies are used: domain-adversarial neural networks and semisupervised generative adversarial neural networks. Overall, accuracy of up to 96.0% was achieved using no labelled data from the target domain moving spectra, and up to 99.68% was achieved when incorporating a single labelled data instance for each material into model training. Using both domain-adaptation methodologies together achieved the highest prediction accuracies on average, as did combining measurements from two near-infrared spectroscopy sensors with different wavelength ranges.

This complex disease is associated with significant socioeconomic burden, reduced work productivity, unemployment, and other social determinants of health (SDOH) disparities. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of SDOH on obesity prevalence among adults in Shelby County, Tennessee, the United States, using a geospatial machine learning approach. Methods: Obesity prevalence was obtained from the publicly available 500 Cities database of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and SDOH indicators were extracted from the US census and the US Department of Agriculture. We examined the geographic distributions of obesity prevalence patterns, using Getis-Ord Gi* statistics and calibrated multiple models to study the association between SDOH and adult obesity. Unsupervised machine learning was used to conduct grouping analysis to investigate the distribution of obesity prevalence and associated SDOH indicators. Results: Results depicted a high percentage of neighborhoods experiencing high adult obesity prevalence within Shelby County. In the census tract, the median household income, as well as the percentage of individuals who were Black, home renters, living below the poverty level, 55 years or older, unmarried, and uninsured, had a significant association with adult obesity prevalence.

To maintain a healthier diet, people must track the number of food calories they consume daily, along with their total calories. There is a growing desire for automated technologies that can help diabetics manage their diet and benefit the population by better analyzing the impact of different types of food on diabetes glucose levels. This research study includes two types of datasets: one for diabetic prediction and one for food recognition. This paper has implemented a diabetic prediction using ANN (3 dense layers), food recognition along with nutrient values by using the CNN model and transfer learning based on VGG16, and a food tracking system to track daily food along with total calories. Finally, our results will be available on the website, which can recognize food and track food items along with estimating calories. With the help of user input based on their glucose readings, the proposed model will predict whether the user has diabetes or not. Based on the user's preference, they can use a food recognition and food tracking system. © 2022 IEEE.","Diabetes; estimating calories; Prediction; recognition; tracking system","Glucose; Tracking (position); Automated technology; Dense layer; Diabetics patients; Estimating calory; Glucose level; Healthy diet; Nutrient values; Recognition; Research studies; Tracking system; Forecasting"

As an aggregate spawning species, Permit require careful management in locations such as the Florida Keys where they experience substantial fishing pressure. We used acoustic telemetry to examine Permit residency patterns over 4 years amongst 12 high-residency sites that are likely important spawning (natural or artificial reefs) or foraging (seagrass flats) habitats. Residency was highest in artificial reefs, supporting previous research that suggests Permit have high fidelity to these habitats compared to seagrass flats and natural reefs on the Florida Reef Tract, which are highly connected. Residency peaked in the spring and summer months in most sites, with a marked decline in the late fall, suggesting potential undetected movement outside the region during that period. Permit exhibited high residency at an important spawning site in March, indicating that this spawning aggregation is vulnerable to fishing pressure with current regulations, which protect Permit from April through July. Seagrass flats in close proximity (<10 km) to spawning locations are likely of high importance to Permit as a food source during the extensive spawning season. Permit residency was generally consistent amongst water temperatures, although residency patterns varied with temperature amongst sites. Residency at natural reef spawning sites increased leading up to the full moon, which is a potential spawning cue for this species. These findings build on a body of recent research on Florida Keys Permit, providing residency information over space and time that may help to further guide the development of marine protected areas and fisheries regulations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Acoustic telemetry; Fish ecology; Machine learning; Marine conservation; Marine protected areas; Recreational fishery; Spatial management","bioacoustics; biotelemetry; conservation management; coral reef; fishing effort; machine learning; marine environment; protected area; recreational activity; seagrass; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Florida Keys; Florida [United States]; United States"

Its significance is evident as it provides almost 20% of calories and protein required for daily human consumption. However, wheat yield is affected by rust disease that can reduce 30% of wheat production which is a serious threat to food security. In order to minimize the loss, it is crucial to identify precisely and localize the wheat rust disease and its infection types. For this purpose, several classification and segmentation techniques are used which are based on machine/deep learning models. This paper provides a realistic analysis and evaluation of various segmentation techniques including Watershed, Grab Cut, and U2-Net. These techniques are applied to the wheat stripe rust data to generate multiple datasets such as Watershed segmented data, GrabCut segmented data, and U2-Net segmented data. Subsequently, a pre-trained deep learning model, ResNet-18 is applied to these datasets to assess the impact of segmentation on classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy (96.196%) is achieved on the dataset segmented by U2-Net. This research collates several state-of-the-art segmentation techniques in terms of correctness and their direct impact on classification accuracy which gives a pragmatic analysis for researchers to choose optimal segmentation technique.

This opens new possibilities for personalized intelligent health and coaching applications. In particular, there is a need for more than simple recommendations and mechanistic interactions. Recent studies have identified nutrition virtual coaching systems (NVC) as a technological solution, possibly bridging technologies such as recommender, informative, persuasive, and argumentation systems. Enabling NVC to explain recommendations and discuss (argument) dietary solutions and alternative items or behaviors is crucial to improve the transparency of these applications and enhance user acceptability and retain their engagement. This study primarily focuses on virtual agents personalizing the generation of food recipes recommendation according to users’ allergies, eating habits, lifestyles, nutritional values, etc. Although the agent would nudge the user to consume healthier food, users may tend to object in favor of tastier food. To resolve this divergence, we propose a user-agent negotiation interacting over the revision of the recommendation (via feedback and explanations) or convincing (via explainable arguments) the user of its benefits and importance. Finally, the paper presents our initial findings on the acceptability and usability of such a system obtained via tests with real users.

At present, no literature supports an effective and efficient method to approach the study of CFEs at both local and regional scales in a comprehensive manner. In Latin America, research is focused the most on the study of food supply stores and their relationship with health outcomes, generally at the local scale. This paper aims to present a complete review and proposal of the change of scale of CFEs problem, taking as an example the geospatial analysis of the food environment of localities with more than 5000 inhabitants in the province of Cordoba. According to 2010 National Census, 95 localities were selected in Cordoba with a population greater than or equal to 5000 inhabitants. Obesity data were extracted from the first National Nutrition and Health Survey (2005). Based on the state-of-the-art, some indicators were selected to characterize the three dimensions (Political, Environmental, and Individual) of CFEs proposed by Glanz et al. [1]. Pearsońs correlation between indicators of CFE was calculated in R software (p< 0.05). Based on the approach proposed by Alvarez DiFino et al. [2], maps were developed in RGB colors to show the conformation of CFEs based on their three dimensions. Finally, an XGBoost model was run to identify the most influential variables on obesity, and to determine the relative importance of each variable within the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations library was used. A mild positive correlation was observed between the number of preschoolers with obesity and socioeconomic status (r=0.30) and a mild negative correlation between the number of obese preschoolers and health vulnerability index (r=-0.30). The generated RGB map shows clearly that the south of the province (localities with higher importance of individual dimension) showed a lower number of cases of obesity compared to the north- northwest of the territory (cities with a higher environmental component and a lower political dimension). Variables and their values, most influential in the obesity modelling were the higher average vegetation index, followed by a lower level of chronic poverty and a higher level of risk of food insecurity. The methods applied to study the CFEs in Latin America are not replicable on a large scale. Our proposal is feasible and shows great potential, considering not only the use of resources but also the incorporation of factors involved in the genesis of a health problem to facilitate efficient decision-making. © 2022 IEEE.","Environment and public health; machine learning; open data; remote sensing","Food supply; Machine learning; Nutrition; Open Data; Public health; Risk assessment; Surveys; Environment and public health; Geomatic; Health outcomes; Latin America; Local scale; Machine-learning; Open datum; Regional scale; Remote-sensing; Three dimensions; Remote sensing"

Therefore, automatic detection of crop planting rows is of great significance for achieving autonomous navigation and precise spraying in intelligent agricultural machinery and is an important part of smart agricultural management. To study the visual navigation line extraction technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in farmland environments and realize real-time precise farmland UAV operations, we propose an improved ENet semantic segmentation network model to perform row segmentation of farmland images. Considering the lightweight and low complexity requirements of the network for crop row detection, the traditional network is compressed and replaced by convolution. Based on the residual network, we designed a network structure of the shunting process, in which low-dimensional boundary information in the feature extraction process is passed backward using the residual stream, allowing efficient extraction of low-dimensional information and significantly improving the accuracy of boundary locations and row-to-row segmentation of farmland crops. According to the characteristics of the segmented image, an improved random sampling consensus algorithm is proposed to extract the navigation line, define a new model-scoring index, find the best point set, and use the least-squares method to fit the navigation line. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm allows accurate and efficient extraction of farmland navigation lines, and it has the technical advantages of strong robustness and high applicability. The algorithm can provide technical support for the subsequent quasi-flight of agricultural UAVs in farmland operations.

In the case of winemaking, a particular application of interest for food informatics is the sensory analysis of wines. This problem can benefit from the strong development that machine learning has achieved in recent decades. However, these data-driven techniques require accurate and sufficient information to generate models capable of predicting the sensory profile of wines. A review of the sensory analysis and volatile composition of wines is presented in this work, along with significant studies on the use of machine learning models to predict wine-related characteristics such as the antioxidant activity of polyphenols of wine and aroma compounds. In this sense, data from a sensory panel and analytical technology were gathered. This literature review reveals the lack of a homogeneous and sufficiently large database of sensory analysis related to the volatile composition of wines to develop machine learning models. However, among artificial intelligence approaches, the application of quantitative structure-odour relationship (QSOR) models is currently gaining importance. Recent studies show that it would be possible to predict quantitatively the sensory analysis of wines by QSOR models, using general volatile composition information. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to identify key aspects and guidelines for the development of this area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Machine learning; QSOR; Volatile composition; Wine aroma","Forecasting; Machine learning; Odors; Sensory analysis; Informatics; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Model learning; Quantitative structure-odor relationship; Quantitative structures; Relationship model; Volatile composition; Wine aromas; Wine"

In this paper, we present a model of automatic message selection tailored on the characteristics of the recipient and focused on the reduction of red meat consumption. This model is obtained through the collaboration between social psychologists and artificial intelligence experts. Starting from selected psychosocial models on food choices and the framing effects of recommendation messages, we involved a sample of Italian participants in an experiment in which they: (a) filled out a first questionnaire, which was aimed at detecting the psychosocial antecedents of the intention to eat red/processed meat; (b) read messages differing as to the framing of the hypothetical consequences of reducing (gain, non-loss) versus not reducing (non-gain, loss) red/processed meat consumption; (c) filled out a second questionnaire, which was aimed at detecting participants’ reaction to the messages, as well as any changes in their intention to consume red/processed meat. Data collected were then employed to learn both the structure and the parameters of a Graphical Causal Model (GCM) based on a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), aimed to predicting the potential effects of message delivery from the observation of the psychosocial antecedents. Such probabilistic predictor is intended as the basis for developing automated interactions strategies using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. Discussion focuses on how to develop automatic interaction strategies able to foster mindful eating, thanks to (a) considering the psychosocial characteristics of the people involved; (b) sending messages tailored on these characteristics; (c) adapting interaction strategies according to people’s reactions.

MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths from 2015–2021 to 1958–2021 in a semi-arid region. Such data extrapolators are imperative to generate longer historical data needed to adequately train and test AI models while enhancing the chance of capturing the effects of extreme climates on spatially variable soil moisture. The MELA-extrapolated local soil moisture subsequently allowed the construction of monthly time-series of field-scale soil moisture distributions with a normalized accuracy of 72% and prediction of countywide annual winter wheat yields – using MELA-extrapolated soil moisture data and eXplainable AI (XAI) – with a normalized accuracy of 81%. Furthermore, the XAI model ranked the predictors based on their importance in estimating winter wheat yields, in which the soil moisture near the surface and in the root zone and precipitation totals were found to be more influential than temperature on crop yields in the semi-arid region. The XAI model also unveiled the inflection points of the predictors beyond which crop yields would increase or decrease. Moreover, the AI-based analyses in conjunction with climate projections from global climate models suggest potential reductions in rainfed crop yields in the study area by 2050 and 2100 in the absence of climate-resilient mitigation and adaptation plans. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial Intelligence; Climate change impacts; Crop yield analysis; Data generator; Soil moisture analysis","Arid regions; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Extrapolation; Image resolution; Soil moisture; Climate change impact; Crop yield; Crop yield analyse; Data generator; Hydroclimatic; Semi-arid region; Soil moisture analysis; Spatial resolution; Winter wheat yields; Yield analysis; Learning algorithms"

However, noninterpretable ML models are often treated as “black boxes” by end-users, which could limit their applicability in critical decision making processes. In this paper, we compared the predictive capabilities of three interpretable ML models with three noninterpretable ML models to answer the overarching question: Is it essential to use noninterpretable ML models for enhanced model predictions from hydro-climatological datasets? The ML model development and comparative analysis were performed using measured climate data and synthetic reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) data, with varying levels of missing values, from five weather stations across the karstic Edwards aquifer region in semi-arid south-central Texas. Our analysis revealed that interpretable tree-based ensemble models produce comparable results to noninterpretable deep learning models on structured hydro-climatological datasets. We showed that the tree-based ensemble model is also capable of imputing varying levels of missing climate data at the weather stations, employing the newly developed sequential transfer-learning technique. We applied an explainable machine learning (eXML) framework to quantify the global order of importance of hydro-climatic (predictor) variables on ETo, while highlighting the local dependencies and interactions amongst the predictors and ETo. The eXML framework also revealed the inflection points of the climate variables at which the transition from low to high daily ETo rates occur.

Results: Among the actionable risk factors that were measured, higher consumption frequencies of animal offal (odds ratios [OR] for an additional time/day = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88-0.95, same unit for OR below unless specified otherwise), dairy products (0.91, 95% CI: 0.88-0.94), freshwater products (0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.96), staple foods (0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96), and coarse food grain (OR for every day vs. rarely = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.98) were associated with lower relative risk of obesity. However, higher restaurant-eating frequency (OR for >4 times/month vs. rarely = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.15-1.29) and longer screen-viewing duration (OR for >2 hours vs. <30 minutes = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10-1.22) were associated with higher relative risk of obesity. Increased exercise frequency was associated with the lowest relative risk of obesity (OR for every day vs. rarely = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.68-0.77). Conclusions: Changes in lifestyle and diet of Chinese children may help relieve their obesity burden. © 2022 The Authors.

This study aimed to develop and determine the accuracy of detecting different ADLs using machine-learning (ML) algorithms and wearable sensors. Eleven post-stroke patients participated in this pilot study at an ADL Simulation Lab across two study visits. We collected blocks of repeated activity (“atomic” activity) performance data to train our ML algorithms during one visit. We evaluated our ML algorithms using independent semi-naturalistic activity data collected at a separate session. We tested Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for model development. XGBoost was the best classification model. We achieved 82% accuracy based on ten ADL tasks. With a model including seven tasks, accuracy improved to 90%. ADL tasks included chopping food, vacuuming, sweeping, spreading jam or butter, folding laundry, eating, brushing teeth, taking off/putting on a shirt, wiping a cupboard, and buttoning a shirt. Results provide preliminary evidence that ADL functioning can be predicted with adequate accuracy using wearable sensors and ML. The use of external validation (independent training and testing data sets) and semi-naturalistic testing data is a major strength of the study and a step closer to the long-term goal of ADL monitoring in real-world settings. Further investigation is needed to improve the ADL prediction accuracy, increase the number of tasks monitored, and test the model outside of a laboratory setting. © 2021 by the authors.

Currently, deep neural networks have been extensively applied in plant disease identification, but such approaches still suffer from low identification accuracy and numerous parameters. Hence, this paper proposes a model combining channel attention and channel pruning called CACPNET, suitable for disease identification of common species. The channel attention mechanism adopts a local cross-channel strategy without dimensionality reduction, which is inserted into a ResNet-18-based model that combines global average pooling with global max pooling to effectively improve the features’ extracting ability of plant leaf diseases. Based on the model’s optimum feature extraction condition, unimportant channels are removed to reduce the model’s parameters and complexity via the L1-norm channel weight and local compression ratio. The accuracy of CACPNET on the public dataset PlantVillage reaches 99.7% and achieves 97.7% on the local peanut leaf disease dataset. Compared with the base ResNet-18 model, the floating point operations (FLOPs) decreased by 30.35%, the parameters by 57.97%, the model size by 57.85%, and the GPU RAM requirements by 8.3%. Additionally, CACPNET outperforms current models considering inference time and throughput, reaching 22.8 ms/frame and 75.5 frames/s, respectively. The results outline that CACPNET is appealing for deployment on edge devices to improve the efficiency of precision agriculture in plant disease detection.

Previous studies have shown that dietary intervention with a slowly digestible carbohydrate (SDC) diet can improve T2DM with almost no side effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of SDC protect against T2DM remains to be elucidated. Methods: The T2DM mice model was established with a high-fat diet and streptozocin injection. Then, SDC was administered for 6 weeks. Bodyweight, food intake, organ indices, fasting blood glucose (FBG), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other biochemical parameters were measured. Histopathological and lipid accumulation analyses were performed, and the glucose metabolism-related gene expressions in the liver and skeletal muscle were determined. Lastly, colonic microbiota was also analyzed. Results: SDC intervention alleviated the weight loss in the pancreas, lowered blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and improved glucose tolerance and HOMA-IR. SDC intervention improved serum lipid profile, adipocytokines levels, and lowered the lipid accumulation in the liver, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and epididymal visceral adipose tissue. In addition, SDC intervention increased the expression levels of IRS-2 and GLUT-2 in liver tissues and elevated GLUT-4 expression levels in skeletal muscle tissues. Notably, SDC intervention decreased the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, increased Desulfovibrio and Lachnospiraceae genus levels, and inhibited the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Conclusions: SDC intervention can improve hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia status in diabetic mice, suggesting that this intervention might be beneficial for T2DM.

Crop production is highly dependent on the type, and nutrition value of soil, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall etc. Farmers lack in determining the precise requirements of a crop, crop yield, and profit. This may cause a huge loss to farmers. Therefore, there is a need for a crop recommender system. Various researchers proposed the crop recommender systems but, these systems lack in automatic prediction of nutrient requirements, and crop yield. Also, the existing systems do not consider the export and import policies, hence fails in precise profit estimation. In this research, The authors address the above-stated challenges, and propose a machine learning based crop recommender system that predict crop yield of 22 varieties of crops. they employ machine learning models namely decision tree, light GBM, naive bayes, support vector machine, logistic, random forest, and Xgboost.

The proposed system is intended primarily for solving the problems faced by the aquaculture farming sector in Taiwan by designing a smart IoT-based fish monitoring and control system equipped with different IoT devices to enable real-time data collection; so that fishpond water-quality conditions and other system parameters can be readily monitored, adjusted, and assessed remotely. To predict the growth of the California Bass fish, this study also develops a deep learning model (DL) that correlates the different parameters of the smart aquaculture system. Bayesian optimization-based hyper-parameter tuning was employed to find the optimal DL model configuration to produce accurate predictions on the given experimental data set. The optimal model produces an R2 value of 0.94 and a mean square error of 0.0015, demonstrating the applicability of the model to predict the desired output. Based on the results of the experiments, the DL model can be incorporated into the autonomous feeding system, reducing the amount of leftover feed. Thus, aquaculture based on the artificial intelligence of things (AIOT) can assist fish farmers in intelligently controlling and managing different fishpond equipment remotely and assist aquaculture operators in performing professional aquaculture, lowering the industry's entry barrier, and promoting aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors","Aquaculture; Bayesian optimization; Big data; Deep neural networks; Internet of things; Smart fish farming",

RFS can manifest variously, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, therefore it may easily be overlooked. RFS prediction using explainable machine learning can improve diagnosis and treatment. Our study aimed to propose a machine learning model for RFS prediction, specifically refeeding hypophosphatemia, to evaluate its performance compared with conventional regression models, and to explain the machine learning classification through Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted including 806 patients, with 2 or more days of nothing-by-mouth prescription, and with phosphate (P) level measurements within 5 days of refeeding were selected. We divided the patients into hypophosphatemia (n = 367) and non-hypophosphatemia groups (n = 439) at a P level of 0.8 mmol/L. Among the features examined within 48 h after admission, we reviewed laboratory test results and electronic medical records. Logistic, Lasso, and ridge regressions were used as conventional models, and performances were compared with our extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Our model was explained using the SHAP value. Results: The areas under the curve were 0.950 (95% confidence interval: 0.924–0.975) for our XGBoost machine learning model and surpassed the performance of conventional regression models; 0.760 (0.707–0.813) for logistic regression, 0.751 (0.694–0.807) for Lasso regression, and 0.758 (0.701–0.809) for ridge regression. According to the SHAP values in the order of importance, low initial P, recent weight loss, high creatinine, diabetes mellitus with insulin use, low haemoglobin A1c, furosemide use, intensive care unit admission, blood urea nitrogen level of 19–65, parenteral nutrition, magnesium below or above the normal range, low potassium, and older age were features to predict refeeding hypophosphatemia. Conclusions: The machine learning model for predicting RFS has a substantially higher effectiveness than conventional regression methods. Creating an accurate risk assessment tool based on machine learning for early identification of patients at risk for RFS can enable careful nutrition management planning and monitoring in the intensive care unit, towards reducing the incidence of RFS-related morbidity and mortality. © 2021 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost); Machine learning; Refeeding hypophosphatemia; Refeeding syndrome; SHAP (Shapley additive explanations)","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; calcium; chlorine; cholesterol; creatinine; furosemide; hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; magnesium; phosphate; potassium; protein; sodium; triacylglycerol; aged; APACHE; Article; body weight loss; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; electronic medical record; female; hematocrit; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; hypophosphatemia; intensive care unit; length of stay; lymphocyte count; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mortality; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nutrition; parenteral nutrition; refeeding syndrome; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; training; urea nitrogen blood level; hypophosphatemia; machine learning; refeeding syndrome; Aged; Humans; Hypophosphatemia; Intensive Care Units; Machine Learning; Refeeding Syndrome; Retrospective Studies"

Bizarrely, in situ conserved CWR populations and the traits one might wish to preserve in them are themselves vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we used a quantitative machine learning predictive approach to project the resistance of CWR populations of lentils to a common disease, lentil rust, caused by fungus Uromyces viciae-fabae. Resistance is measured through a proxy quantitative value, DSr (Disease Severity relative), quite complex and expensive to get. Therefore, machine learning is a convenient tool to predict this magnitude using a well-curated georeferenced calibration set. Previous works have provided a binary outcome (resistant vs. non-resistant), but that approach is not fine enough to answer three practical questions: which variables are key to predict rust resistance, which CWR populations are resistant to rust under current environmental conditions, and which of them are likely to keep this trait under different climate change scenarios. We first predict rust resistance in present time for crop wild relatives that grow up inside protected areas. Then, we use the same models under future climate IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios to predict future DSr values. Populations that are rust-resistant by now and under future conditions are optimal candidates for further evaluation and in situ conservation of this valuable trait. We have found that rust-resistance variation as a result of climate change is not uniform across the geographic scope of the study (the Mediterranean basin), and that candidate populations share some interesting common environmental conditions.

School dropout is a culmination of various factors that drive children to leave school, and timely policy responses are most needed to address these underlying factors and improve school retention of children over time. However, applying ML approaches to school dropout prediction is an important challenge, especially in low-income countries, where data collection and management systems are relatively more prone to financial and technical constraints. For this reason, this study suggests using already collected household panel data to predict the probability of school dropout and explore feature importance for primary school children in Malawi through ML models. A rich set of variables is obtained in this study from the household data and used to build Random Forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Ridge and multilayer neural network (MNN) models. The study further explores how performance metrics differ when we embed the training samples' weights representing frequency in sampling design into the cost function of these ML models to discuss the implications of using household data in computational social science. LASSO and MNN models trained with sample weights become more prominent due to their higher recall rates of 80.6% and 78.8%. Compared to the baseline model trained with sample weights, the recall rate gained is roughly 56 percentage points using LASSO and 54 percentage points using MNN. Also, comparing LASSO and MNN trained with and without sample weights reveals that training models with sample weights increase the recall rate roughly by 11 percentage points for LASSO and 12 percentage points for MNN. Lastly, the paper provides a comprehensive and unified approach to better interpret the models using a game-theoretic approach – SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) – to quantify feature importance. As a result, socio-economic characteristics of children, such as working in household farming and father's education level, are among the most important features contributing to the probability of school dropout in ML models. This study argues that the weighted sample structure of household data and its wide range of variables explored through the SHAP method for feature importance can enrich the literature and yield valuable results to harness data science for society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Educational data mining; Feature importance; Machine learning; Sample weights; School dropout prediction",

Finding quantitative imaging biomarkers from WSIs directly for the prediction of disease-free survival (DFS) in stage I–III melanoma patients is crucial to optimize patient management. In this study, we designed a deep learning-based model with the aim of learning prognostic biomarkers from WSIs to predict 1-year DFS in cutaneous melanoma patients. First, WSIs referred to a cohort of 43 patients (31 DF cases, 12 non-DF cases) from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Cutaneous Melanoma (CPTAC-CM) public database were firstly annotated by our expert pathologists and then automatically split into crops, which were later employed to train and validate the proposed model using a fivefold cross-validation scheme for 5 rounds. Then, the model was further validated on WSIs related to an independent test, i.e. a validation cohort of 11 melanoma patients (8 DF cases, 3 non-DF cases), whose data were collected from Istituto Tumori ‘Giovanni Paolo II’ in Bari, Italy. The quantitative imaging biomarkers extracted by the proposed model showed prognostic power, achieving a median AUC value of 69.5% and a median accuracy of 72.7% on the public cohort of patients. These results remained comparable on the validation cohort of patients with an AUC value of 66.7% and an accuracy value of 72.7%, respectively. This work is contributing to the recently undertaken investigation on how treat features extracted from raw WSIs to fulfil prognostic tasks involving melanoma patients.

Its potential as a sustainable food source has been recognised within the EU Farm to Fork strategy and by the targeting of EU Green Deal research funds. Aquafeed is the primary source of environmental cost in farmed finfish and shrimp life cycle assessments (LCA), and thus, emerging ingredients have a key role to play in increasing its sustainability. This paper proposes that the development and ‘design’ of feed compositions can be disrupted by innovative approaches that simultaneously optimise—via multicriteria analysis—ingredient selection through leveraging economic, nutritional, life cycle cost and environmental datasets. This would be supported by the ongoing collection and curation of these same resources. Further, integration of these disparate resources can enable advanced ingredient traceability. The outcome of such an approach would greatly contribute to increasingly efficient aquafeed production. © 2021 The Author(s)","Aquafeed; Life cycle assessment; Machine learning; Nutrition; Seafood; Sustainable aquaculture",

This diagram is often called the “central dogma.” Subsequently, the relationships between different steps of the “central dogma” have been shown to be considerably complex, mostly because of the emerging world of small molecules. It is noteworthy that metabolites can be generated from the diet through gut microbiome metabolism, serve as substrates for epigenetic modifications, destabilize DNA quadruplexes, and follow Lamarckian inheritance. Small molecules were once considered the missing link in the “central dogma”; however, recently they have acquired a central role, and their general perception as downstream products has become reductionist. Metabolomics is a large-scale analysis of metabolites, and this emerging field has been shown to be the closest omics associated with the phenotype and concomitantly, the basis for all omics. Aim of review: Herein, we propose a broad updated perspective for the flux of information diagram centered in metabolomics, including the influence of other factors, such as epigenomics, diet, nutrition, and the gut- microbiome.

In this review, we provide an overview of the main and latest applications of AI in nutrition research and identify gaps to address to potentialize this emerging field. AI algorithms may help better understand and predict the complex and non-linear interactions between nutrition-related data and health outcomes, particularly when large amounts of data need to be structured and integrated, such as in metabolomics. AI-based approaches, including image recognition, may also improve dietary assessment by maximizing efficiency and addressing systematic and random errors associated with self-reported measurements of dietary intakes. Finally, AI applications can extract, structure and analyze large amounts of data from social media platforms to better understand dietary behaviours and perceptions among the population. In summary, AI-based approaches will likely improve and advance nutrition research as well as help explore new applications. However, further research is needed to identify areas where AI does deliver added value compared with traditional approaches, and other areas where AI is simply not likely to advance the field.

Indeed, one element responsible for this situation is insect pests. Early detection of pests based on parcel images is a real challenge in the context of precision agriculture. Nowadays, technical advances in deep neural networks have led to better results in all areas, including crop health management in agriculture. Despite these satisfactory results of deep neural networks in image classification tasks, one of the drawbacks is that it is difficult to decode what the neural networks have learned. The proposed method consists of identifying and locating insect pests in crops using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The localization of insects from the input data is based on explainability methods. For this, explainability highlights the colors and shapes captured by the CNNs using visualization maps. This provides opportunities for human interaction with the learning system for validation of the results provided by the CNN models. In this study, we used over 75,000 images for 102 different pest categories from the IP102 reference dataset. Various explainability methods are combined to formally interpret insect location. The degree of combination is quantified by the mutual information score. The obtained results allow a better interpretation of the reasoning performed by the deep learning system and identified an optimal number of feature extraction layers. Consequently, we simplified a CNN model by decreasing the number of network parameters by 58.90%.

No prior studies have attempted a contemporary machine learning approach to predict depression using subjective and objective hearing loss predictors. The objective was to deploy supervised machine learning to predict scores on a validated depression scale using subjective and objective audiometric variables and other health determinant predictors. Design: A large predictor set of health determinants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015-2016 database was used to predict adults' scores on a validated instrument to screen for the presence and severity of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). After model training, the relative influence of individual predictors on depression scores was stratified and analyzed. Model prediction performance was determined by prediction error metrics. Results: The test set mean absolute error was 3.03 (95% confidence interval: 2.91 to 3.14) and 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 2.48 to 2.62) on datasets with audiology-only predictors and all predictors, respectively, on the PHQ-9's 27-point scale. Participants' self-reported frustration when talking to members of family or friends due to hearing loss was the fifth-most influential of all predictors. Of the top 10 most influential audiometric predictors, five were related to social contexts, two for significant noise exposure, two objective audiometric parameters, and one presence of bothersome tinnitus. Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict PHQ-9 depression scale scores from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. The most influential audiometric predictors of higher scores on a validated depression scale were social dynamics of hearing loss and not objective audiometric testing. Such models could be useful in predicting depression scale scores at the point-of-care in conjunction with a standard audiologic assessment. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, the challenge is to convert short and abrupt phenology data with limited distributional information into ecological relevant information. In this work, we present a novel approach to analyze phenology data based on non-parametric Bayesian methods and develop degree-day (DD) risk thresholds for Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to be used in a decision support system for dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production. The replication of each Bayesian bootstrap generates a posterior probability for each sampling set by considering that the prior unknown distribution of pest phenology is Dirichlet distribution. We computed R = 10,000 temperature-driven pest phenology replicates, to estimate the 2.5%, 50% and 95.5% percentiles (PC) of each flight generation peak in terms of heat summations. The related DD thresholds were: 114.04 (PC 2.5%) 131.8 (PC 50%) and 150.9 (PC 95.5%) for the first, 525.8 (PC 2.5%), 551.7 (PC 50%) and 577.6 (PC 95.5%) for the second and 992.7 (PC 2.5%), 1021.5 (PC 50%) and 1050 (PC 95.5%) for the third flight, respectively. The thresholds were evaluated by estimating the posterior differences between the predicted (2021) and observed (2022) phenology metrics and are in most cases in acceptable levels. The bootstrapped Bayesian risk thresholds have the advantage to be used in modeling short and noisy data sets providing tailored pest forecast without any parametric assumptions. In a second step the above thresholds were integrated to a sub-module of a digital weather-driven real time decision support system for precise pest management for dry bean crops. The system consists of a customized cloud based telemetric meteorological network, established over the border area of the Prespa National Park in Northern Greece, and delivers real time data and pest specific forecast to the end user. © 2022 by the authors.","cotton bollworm; decision support system; pest management; precise plant protection; simulation and forecast",

Though nutritional content information can positively influence consumption behavior, added sugar is not currently required to be disclosed in all countries. However, a growing proportion of the world’s population has access to mobile devices, which allow for the development of digital solutions to support health-related decisions and behaviors. To test whether advances in computational science can be leveraged to develop an accurate and scalable model to estimate the added sugar content of foods based on their nutrient profile, we collected comprehensive nutritional information, including information on added sugar content, for 69,769 foods. Eighty percent of this data was used to train a gradient boosted tree model to estimate added sugar content, while 20% of it was held out to assess the predictive accuracy of the model. The performance of the resulting model showed 93.25% explained variance per default portion size (84.32% per 100 kcal). The mean absolute error of the estimate was 0.84 g per default portion size (0.81 g per 100 kcal). This model can therefore be used to deliver accurate estimates of added sugar through digital devices in countries where the information is not disclosed on packaged foods, thus enabling consumers to be aware of the added sugar content of a wide variety of foods. © 2023 by the authors.","added sugar; diabetes; informed decisions; machine learning in nutrition; obesity","carbohydrate; decision making; food; human; nutritional value; obesity; Carbohydrates; Decision Making; Food; Humans; Nutritive Value; Obesity; Sugars"

Early prediction of crop performance can reduce this constraint by allowing breeders more time to focus on the highest-performing varieties. Here, we present a multimodal deep learning model for predicting the performance of maize (Zea mays) at an early developmental stage, offering the potential to accelerate crop breeding. We employed multispectral images and eight vegetation indices, collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle approximately 60 days after sowing, over three consecutive growing cycles (2017, 2018 and 2019). The multimodal deep learning approach was used to integrate field management and genotype information with the multispectral data, providing context to the conditions that the plants experienced during the trial. Model performance was assessed using holdout data, in which the model accurately predicted the yield (RMSE 1.07 t/ha, a relative RMSE of 7.60% of 16 t/ha, and R2 score 0.73) and identified the majority of high-yielding varieties, outperforming previously published models for early yield prediction. The inclusion of vegetation indices was important for model performance, with a normalized difference vegetation index and green with normalized difference vegetation index contributing the most to model performance.

The present study analyses agricultural drought risk with respect to different drought severities. Different drought indices–namely, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Soil moisture Index (SSI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) – are used to evaluate the conditional probability. Non-stationary analysis is carried out for SPEI and SSI to incorporate the impact of large-scale oscillations and regional hydrological variability. Copula analysis is performed between drought conditions and various crop yield anomalies over Maharashtra, India, during 1998–2015. The outcomes suggest that SPEI is a significant drought indicator over the maximum number of districts in all the crops. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Indian Summer Monsoon Index (ISMI) are selected as suitable covariates to model the non-stationarity in the SPEI time series. The drought risk is estimated to increase with drought severity for all of the selected crops.

However, despite the public health importance, most countries have not mandated the labeling of added-sugar content on packaged foods and beverages, making it difficult for consumers to avoid products with added sugar, and limiting the ability of policymakers to identify priority products for intervention. Objective: The aim was to develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of added-sugar content in packaged products using available nutrient, ingredient, and food category information. Methods: The added-sugar prediction algorithm was developed using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and packaged food information from the US Label Insight dataset (n = 70,522). A synthetic dataset of Australian packaged products (n = 500) was used to assess validity and generalization. Performance metrics included the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and Spearman rank correlation (ρ). To benchmark the KNN approach, the KNN approach was compared with an existing added-sugar prediction approach that relies on a series of manual steps. Results: Compared with the existing added-sugar prediction approach, the KNN approach was similarly apt at explaining variation in added-sugar content (R2 = 0.96 vs. 0.97, respectively) and ranking products from highest to lowest in added-sugar content (ρ = 0.91 vs. 0.93, respectively), while less apt at minimizing absolute deviations between predicted and true values (MAE = 1.68 g vs. 1.26 g per 100 g or 100 mL, respectively). Conclusions: KNN can be used to predict added-sugar content in packaged products with a high degree of validity. Being automated, KNN can easily be applied to large datasets. Such predicted added-sugar levels can be used to monitor the food supply and inform interventions aimed at reducing added-sugar intake. © 2021 The Author(s).","added sugar; automated; estimation; machine learning; packaged foods; prediction","carbohydrate; Australia; beverage; food packaging; machine learning; nutrition policy; nutritional value; Australia; Beverages; Food Labeling; Machine Learning; Nutrition Policy; Nutritive Value; Sugars"

Utilization of a k-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm explained a greater proportion of variance in fiber content than an existing manual fiber prediction approach (R2 = 0.84 vs. R2 = 0.68). Our findings highlight the opportunity to use machine learning to efficiently predict the fiber content of packaged products on a large scale. © 2021 by the authors.

The methodology involved applying elasticnet, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting to input–output data from an industrial-scale anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) facility. The models were used to predict biomethane for 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 40-day time horizons. These models were fit on four years of operational data. The results showed that elastic net (a model with assumptions of linearity) was clearly outperformed by random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which had out-of-sample R2 values ranging between 0.80 and 0.88, depending on the time horizon. In addition, feature importance and partial dependence analysis demonstrated the marginal and interaction effects on biomethane of selected biowaste inputs. For instance, food waste co-digested with percolate were shown to have strong positive interaction effects. One implication of this study is that XGBoost and random forest algorithms applied to industrial-scale ACoD data provide dependable prediction results and may be a useful complement for experimental and mechanistic/theoretical models of anaerobic digestion, especially where detailed substrate characterization is difficult. However, these models have limitations, and suggestions for deriving additional value from these methods are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic co-digestion; Biomethane; Machine learning; Random forest; XGBoost","Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Anaerobic co-digestion; Biomethane; Machine learning models; Positive interaction; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Substrate characterization; XGBoost; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; biogas; data interpretation; gas production; input-output analysis; machine learning; methane; prediction; anaerobic digestion; article; elastic tissue; food waste; prediction; random forest; theoretical study; anaerobic growth; food; machine learning; waste disposal; methane; Anaerobiosis; Food; Machine Learning; Methane; Refuse Disposal"

We cross-sectionally examined the eating habits of an older Mediterranean population to profile dietary features most associated with physical frailty. Methods: Clinical and physical examination, routine biomarkers, medical history, and anthropometry were analyzed in 1502 older adults (65 +). CHS criteria were applied to classify physical frailty, and a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire to assess diet. The population was subdivided by physical frailty status (frail or non-frail). Raw and adjusted logistic regression models were applied to three clusters of dietary variables (food groups, macronutrients, and micronutrients), previously selected by a LASSO approach to better predict diet-related frailty determinants. Results: A lower consumption of wine (OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.997–0.999) and coffee (OR 0.994, 95% CI 0.989–0.999), as well as a cluster of macro and micronutrients led by PUFAs (OR 0.939, 95% CI 0.896–0.991), zinc (OR 0.977, 95% CI 0.952–0.998), and coumarins (OR 0.631, 95% CI 0.431–0.971), was predictive of non-frailty, but higher legumes intake (OR 1.005, 95%CI 1.000–1.009) of physical frailty, regardless of age, gender, and education level. Conclusions: Higher consumption of coffee and wine, as well as PUFAs, zinc, and coumarins, as opposed to legumes, may work well in protecting against a physical frailty profile of aging in a Mediterranean setting. Longitudinal investigations are needed to better understand the causal potential of diet as a modifiable contributor to frailty during aging. © 2022, The Author(s).","Dietary habits; Food intake; Mediterranean diet; Older population; Physical frailty; Salus in Apulia Study",

Using a dataset of three years of milk supply from Irish dairy farms (N = 2,479), we produce accurate full-year forecasts for each individual farm, by augmenting that farm’s data with data from nearest-neighboring farms, based on the similarity of their time series profiles (using Dynamic Time Warping). A study comparing four methods (Seasonal Naïve, LSTM, Prophet, ProphetNN ) showed that the method using CBR data-augmentation (ProphetNN) outperformed the other evaluated methods. We also demonstrate the utility of CBR in providing farmers with novel prefactual explanations for forecasting that could help them to realize actions that could boost future milk yields and profitability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CBR; Dairy production; Data augmentation; Prefactual explanation; Smart agriculture; Time series","Case based reasoning; Dairies; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Nearest neighbor search; Sustainable development; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Dairy production; Data augmentation; Farm management; Lower resolution; Milk supply; Precision Agriculture; Prefactual explanation; Smart agricultures; Times series; Time series"

It is of significance to investigate the spatial–temporal pattern and the dominant influence of natural and human factors on agricultural drought disasters for drought hazard relief. In this study, Mann–Kendall test was adopted to explore the evolution of agricultural drought disasters. Random forest algorithm, which integrates feature importance and accumulated local effects plot, was applied to quantify the effect of principal influencing factors on agricultural drought disasters. Results show that over the period from 1950 to 2019, agricultural drought disasters in China have undergone significant fluctuations. The spatial pattern of agricultural drought disaster tends to decrease in severity from north to south. The total sown area of crops, precipitation, effective irrigation area, domestic patent application authorization, and regional GDP are the top 5 dominant factors influencing agricultural drought disasters. It also found that agricultural drought disaster negatively correlates with precipitation, domestic patent application authorization, and regional GDP, and the nonlinear response of agricultural drought disaster to total sown area of crops and effective irrigation area can be basically divided into two stages. In the first stage, with the increase of feature value, agricultural drought disaster is also increasing. In the second stage, with the increase of feature value, agricultural drought disaster is growing slow or just decreasing. The results can deepen the understanding of agricultural drought disasters and provide scientific basis for drought event monitoring, evaluation, and early warning.

This present study aims to evaluate the comparative performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and four pre-trained deep CNN models, for automatic and rapid detections of Hispa, brown spot, leaf blast, and NPK deficiency symptoms from public and real field images. Deep learning models were trained using different public and field datasets combinations. Best accuracy was achieved for mixed public and field datasets rather than solely field or solely public datasets, with VGG19 models achieving 91.8% accuracy. Relatively simple structured CNN was found to predict phosphate deficient leaves with better performance (96% accuracy) than the other four advanced models, while VGG16 performed better for leaf blast and N deficiency identification. Likewise, ResNet50 could be recommended among the five models for the Potassium deficient leaf identification, while for the Hispa pest, VGG19 outperforms the InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG16 models, and was slightly better than the basic CNN. The implication of the study is enormous considering practical application as it deals with the complex dataset of pest, disease and nutrient deficiency. This non-invasive way of detecting different stresses of rice could help farmers in practicing precision agriculture. The findings from this study could be used to develop a user-friendly interface for the rapid and inexpensive detection of diseases and nutrition status by farmers, in a non-destructive way.

LGA birth rates have increased in many countries since the late 20th century, partially due to a rise in maternal body mass index, which is associated with LGA risk. The objective of the current study was to develop LGA prediction models for women with overweight and obesity for the purpose of clinical decision support in a clinical setting. Maternal characteristics, serum biomarkers and fetal anatomy scan measurements for 465 pregnant women with overweight and obesity before and at approximately 21 weeks gestation were obtained from the PEARS (Pregnancy Exercise and Nutrition with smart phone application support) study data. Random forest, support vector machine, adaptive boosting and extreme gradient boosting algorithms were applied with synthetic minority over-sampling technique to develop probabilistic prediction models. Two models were developed for use in different settings: a clinical setting for white women (AUC-ROC of 0.75); and a clinical setting for women of all ethnicity and regions (AUC-ROC of 0.57). Maternal age, mid upper arm circumference, white cell count at the first antenatal visit, fetal biometry and gestational age at fetal anatomy scan were found to be important predictors of LGA. Pobal HP deprivation index and fetal biometry centiles, which are population-specific, are also important. Moreover, we explained our models with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to improve explainability, which was proven effective by case studies. Our explainable models can effectively predict the probability of an LGA birth for women with overweight and obesity, and are anticipated to be useful to support clinical decision-making and for the development of early pregnancy intervention strategies to reduce pregnancy complications related to LGA. © 2023 Du et al.

The red pepper (RP), fabricated isot (FI), and customary isot (CI) spices were stored for 12 months and the variations in the organic compound content were monitored every 3 months. The data set has been subjected to a supervised ML method Random Forest (RF), unsupervised ML methods principal component analysis (PCA), t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The classification accuracy yielded by the RF model was 100%. RF model showed that terpenoids, acids, and alkanes were ineffective in identifying the differences between pepper spices, but glucose, succinic acid, citric acid, and fructose were primarily responsible for the variations between pepper spices. FI peppers differed significantly from other pepper spices in terms of their chemical compositions. Although most organic compounds exhibited positive correlations; furan-fructose, furan-glucose, furan-citric acid, and glucose-malic acid showed negative correlations. RP peppers were mostly stable for the first 6 months of storage, but after this month, due to changes in malic acid, aldehyde, glucose, and fructose, they displayed similar properties as CI. The organic compound content of CI peppers rapidly changed in the first 3 months of storage and stayed almost stable for the remaining 9 months. Various ML methods were effectively employed in this study to examine the changes that different pepper spices exhibited in association with storage. Practical applications: Peppers, which are often used in food products for the purpose of bitterness, flavor, and color are mostly consumed after drying. The dried pepper is stored for a long time before consuming. During storage, there are significant changes in the organic compound composition and pepper quality.

Hybrid retrieval models are of interest to run in these platforms as they combine the advantages of physically-based radiative transfer models (RTM) with the flexibility of machine learning regression algorithms. Previous research with GEE primarily relied on processing bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance data, which requires atmospheric correction. In the present study, we implemented hybrid models directly into GEE for processing Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C (L1C) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data into crop traits. To achieve this, a training dataset was generated using the leaf-canopy RTM PROSAIL in combination with the atmospheric model 6SV. Gaussian process regression (GPR) retrieval models were then established for eight essential crop traits namely leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water content, leaf dry matter content, fractional vegetation cover, leaf area index (LAI), and upscaled leaf variables (i.e., canopy chlorophyll content, canopy water content and canopy dry matter content). An important pre-requisite for implementation into GEE is that the models are sufficiently light in order to facilitate efficient and fast processing. Successful reduction of the training dataset by 78% was achieved using the active learning technique Euclidean distance-based diversity (EBD). With the EBD-GPR models, highly accurate validation results of LAI and upscaled leaf variables were obtained against in situ field data from the validation study site Munich-North-Isar (MNI), with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) from 6% to 13%. Using an independent validation dataset of similar crop types (Italian Grosseto test site), the retrieval models showed moderate to good performances for canopy-level variables, with NRMSE ranging from 14% to 50%, but failed for the leaf-level estimates. Obtained maps over the MNI site were further compared against Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) vegetation estimates generated from the ESA Sentinels' Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical Processor, proving high consistency of both retrievals (R2 from 0.80 to 0.94). Finally, thanks to the seamless GEE processing capability, the TOA-based mapping was applied over the entirety of Germany at 20 m spatial resolution including information about prediction uncertainty.

We combined OPLS-DA with machine learning modelling to identify metabolites discrimination of the treatment groups. Both phenol-enriched OO interventions decreased the levels of glutamine, creatinine, creatine, dimethylamine, and histidine in comparison to VOO one. In addition, FOOT decreased the plasma levels of glycine and DMSO2 compared to VOO, while FOO decreased the circulating alanine concentrations but increased the plasma levels of acetone and 3-HB compared to VOO.

To address this challenge, a popular approach is to design a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model that extracts visual disease features in the images and then identifies the diseases based on the extracted features. This approach performs well under simple background conditions, but has low accuracy and poor robustness under complex backgrounds. In this paper, an end-to-end disease identification model composed of a disease-spot region detector and a disease classifier (YOLOv5s + BiCMT) was proposed. Specifically, the YOLOv5s network was used to detect the disease-spot regions so as to provide a regional attention mechanism to facilitate the disease identification task of the classifier. For the classifier, a Bidirectional Cross-Modal Transformer (BiCMT) model combining the image and text modal information was constructed, which utilizes the correlation and complementarity between the features of the two modalities to achieve the fusion and recognition of disease features. Meanwhile, the problem of inconsistent lengths among different modal data sequences was solved. Eventually, the YOLOv5s + BiCMT model achieved the optimal results on a small dataset. Its Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity reached 99.23, 97.37, 97.54, and 99.54%, respectively. This paper proves that the bidirectional cross-modal feature fusion by combining disease images and texts is an effective method to identify vegetable diseases in field environments.

A suite of methods currently exist to estimate the yield potential of a crop, but there are no approaches that predict the site- and season-specific yield potential using datasets that are readily available and easily accessible for farmers. The aim of this study was to fill this need and develop a novel approach to identify crop yield gaps through site- and season-specific models of crop yield potential. The study focused on cotton lint yield, with data from 14 different seasons and 68 different fields from a collection of large, irrigated cotton farms in eastern Australia. This abundance of yield data was then joined with other spatial and temporal datasets that describe yield, such as rainfall, temperature, soil, and management. A quantile random forest machine learning model was then used to model yield at 30 m resolution, where the 95th percentile predictions were treated as the yield potential. The yield gaps at a 30 m resolution were then estimated for all seasons and sites. The results were compared to a more traditional ‘historical maximum yield’ approach, where no data modelling and only empirical yield data was used to estimate the yield potential. This revealed that there was a general agreement between the two approaches, although the quantile machine learning approach is both site- and season-specific, not just site-specific. Overall, there is a great need for alternative approaches to estimate yield potential and yield gaps, as the approaches currently available possess many limitations. The approach developed in this study has the potential for wide-spread adoption in broadacre cropping systems, and if the causes of yield gaps are identified, could lead to the implementation of management strategies to close them. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cotton; Data-driven models; Irrigation; Precision agriculture; Yield stability; Yield variability",

The relationship between bacteria whose ecological niche is the eukaryote, and the eukaryote, is often symbiosis or stasis. Some bacteria, however, seek advantage in this relationship. One of the most successful - to the disadvantage of the eukaryote - is the small (less than 1 μm diameter) and nearly spherical Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. For decades, successful clinical control of its infection has been accomplished using β-lactam antibiotics such as the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Over these same decades S. aureus has perfected resistance mechanisms against these antibiotics, which are then countered by new generations of β-lactam structure. This review addresses the current breadth of biochemical and microbiological efforts to preserve the future of the β-lactam antibiotics through a better understanding of how S. aureus protects the enzyme targets of the β-lactams, the penicillin-binding proteins. The penicillin-binding proteins are essential enzyme catalysts for the biosynthesis of the cell wall, and understanding how this cell wall is integrated into the protective cell envelope of the bacterium may identify new antibacterials and new adjuvants that preserve the efficacy of the β-lactams. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Amides; Antibiotics; Biochemistry; Ecology; Enzymes; Staphylococcus aureus; Antibacterials; Cell envelopes; Ecological niche; Enzyme catalysts; Gram positive; Multicellular eukaryotes; Penicillin- binding proteins; Resistance mechanisms; Bacteria; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; beta lactam; cephalosporin derivative; enzyme inhibitor; penicillin binding protein; penicillin derivative; protein binding; animal; beta-lactam resistance; biocatalysis; cell wall; chemistry; drug development; human; metabolism; protein conformation; Staphylococcus aureus; structure activity relation; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactams; Biocatalysis; Cell Wall; Cephalosporins; Drug Discovery; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Penicillin-Binding Proteins; Penicillins; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Staphylococcus aureus; Structure-Activity Relationship"

Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease is considered a major threat to durum (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum (Desfontaines) Husnache) and bread wheat (T. aestivum L.) cultivars and is mainly managed by the application of fungicides at anthesis. However, fungicides are applied when FHB symptoms are clearly visible and the spikes are almost entirely bleached (% of diseased spikelets > 80%), by when it is too late to control FHB disease. For this reason, farmers often react by performing repeated fungicide treatments that, however, due to the advanced state of the infection, cause a waste of money and pose significant risks to the environment and non-target organisms. In the present study, we used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) and red-green-blue (RGB) imaging for FHB detection in T. turgidum (cv. Marco Aurelio) under natural field conditions. TIR and RGB data coupled with ground-based measurements such as spike’s temperature, photosynthetic efficiency and molecular identification of FHB pathogens, detected FHB at anthesis half-way (Zadoks stage 65, ZS 65), when the percentage (%) of diseased spikelets ranged between 20% and 60%. Moreover, in greenhouse experiments the transcripts of the key genes involved in stomatal closure were mostly up-regulated in F. graminearum-inoculated plants, demonstrating that the physiological mechanism behind the spike’s temperature increase and photosynthetic efficiency decrease could be attributed to the closure of the guard cells in response to F. graminearum. In addition, preliminary analysis revealed that there is differential regulation of genes between drought-stressed and F. graminearum-inoculated plants, suggesting that there might be a possibility to discriminate between water stress and FHB infection. This study shows the potential of UAV-based TIR and RGB imaging for field phenotyping of wheat and other cereal crop species in response to environmental stresses. This is anticipated to have enormous promise for the detection of FHB disease and tremendous implications for optimizing the application of fungicides, since global food crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts. © Copyright © 2021 Francesconi, Harfouche, Maesano and Balestra.","durum wheat; early disease detection; Fusarium head blight; gene expression; high-throughput plant phenotyping; RGB imaging; thermal imaging",

This work assesses the use of cloud-based artificial intelligence to detect early indicators of water stress across six container-grown ornamental shrub species. Near-infrared images were previously collected with modified Canon and MAPIR Survey II cameras deployed via a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) at an altitude of 30 meters. Cropped images of plants in no, low-, and high-water stress conditions were split into four-fold cross-validation sets and used to train models through IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service. Despite constraints such as small sample size (36 plants, 150 images) and low image resolution (150 pixels by 150 pixels per plant),Watson generated models were able to detect indicators of stress after 48 hours of water deprivation with a significant to marginally significant degree of separation in four out of five species tested (p < 0.10). Two models were also able to detect indicators of water stress after only 24 hours, with models trained on images of as few as eight water-stressed Buddleia plants achieving an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9884 across four folds. Ease of pre-processing, minimal amount of training data required, and outsourced computation make cloud-based artificial intelligence services such as IBM Watson Visual Recognition an attractive tool for agriculture analytics. Cloud-based artificial intelligence can be combined with technologies such as sUAS and spectral imaging to help crop producers identify deficient irrigation strategies and intervene before crop value is diminished. When brought to scale, frameworks such as these can drive responsive irrigation systems that monitor crop status in real-time and maximize sustainable water use. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Container-grown; Deep learning; Machine learning; Neural network; Ornamental; Precision agriculture; sUAS; Visual recognition; Water stress","Containers; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Irrigation; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Real time systems; Spectroscopy; Training aircraft; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water conservation; Area under the curves; Near- infrared images; Ornamental; Small unmanned aircrafts; sUAS; Sustainable water use; Visual recognition; Water stress; Artificial intelligence"

The need to work with unlabeled data, explainable approaches, unsupervised and domain independent solutions further increases the complexity of this task. Currently, existing techniques only partially solve the problem and have several limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology of descriptive text mining, capable of offering accurate explanations in unsupervised settings and of quantifying the results based on their statistical significance. Considering the strong growth of patient communities on social platforms such as Facebook, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the contribution by taking the short social posts related to Esophageal Achalasia as a typical case study. Specifically, the methodology produces useful explanations about the experiences of patients and caregivers. Starting directly from the unlabeled patient’s posts, we derive correct scientific correlations among symptoms, drugs, treatments, foods and so on.

Prolonged droughts have negative impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, society, and the economy. Although existing drought index products are widely utilized in drought monitoring, the coarse spatial resolution greatly limits their applications on regional or local scales. Machine learning driven by remote sensing observations offers an opportunity to monitor regional scale droughts. However, the limited time range of remote sensing observations such as vegetation index (VI) resulted in a substantial gap in generating high resolution drought index products before 2000. This study generated spatiotemporally continuous Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data spanning from 1901–2018 in southwestern China by machine learning. It indicated that four Classification and Regression Tree (CART) approaches, decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT) and extra trees (ET), can provide valid local drought information by downscaling the Estación Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD) data. The in-situ SPEI dataset produced by the Penman–Monteith method was used as a benchmark to evaluate the temporal and spatial performance of the downscaled SPEI. In addition, the necessity of VI in SPEI downscaling was also assessed. The results showed that: (1) the ET-based product has the best performance (R2 = 0.889, MAE = 0.232, RMSE = 0.432); (2) the VI provides no significant improvement for SPEI re-construction; (3) topography exerts an obvious influence on the downscaling process, and (4) the downscaled SPEI shows more consistency with the in-situ SPEI compared with EEAD SPEI. The proposed method can be easily extended to other areas without in-situ data and enhance the ability of long-term drought monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.

We aimed to identify early life risk factors for childhood overweight/obesity among preterm infants and to determine feeding practices that could modify the identified risk factors. Methods: A total of 338,413 mother-child pairs were enrolled in the Jiaxing Birth Cohort (1999 to 2013), and 2125 eligible singleton preterm born children were included for analyses. We obtained data on health examination, anthropometric measurement, lifestyle, and dietary habits of each participant at their visits to clinics. An interpretable machine learning-based analytic framework was used to identify early life predictors for childhood overweight/obesity, and Poisson regression was used to examine the associations between feeding practices and the identified leading predictor. Results: Of the eligible 2125 preterm infants (863 [40.6%] girls), 274 (12.9%) developed overweight/obesity at age 4-7 years. We summarized early life variables into 25 features and identified two most important features as predictors for childhood overweight/obesity: trajectory of infant BMI (body mass index) Z-score change during the first year of corrected age and maternal BMI at enrollment. According to the impacts of different BMI Z-score trajectories on the outcome, we classified this feature into the favored and unfavored trajectories. Compared with early introduction of solid foods (≤ 3 months of corrected age), introducing solid foods after 6 months of corrected age was significantly associated with 11% lower risk (risk ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97) of being in the unfavored trajectory. Conclusions: The trajectory of BMI Z-score change within the first year of life is the most important predictor for childhood overweight/obesity among preterm infants. Introducing solid foods after 6 months of corrected age is a recommended feeding practice for mitigating the risk of being in the unfavored trajectory. © 2020 The Author(s).","Childhood obesity; Early life risk factors; Machine learning; Preterm infants","age distribution; anthropometry; Apgar score; Article; birth weight; breast feeding; child; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; controlled study; disease severity; early life stress; female; gestational age; human; infant; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical examination; nutritional assessment; preschool child; prospective study; risk factor; school child; algorithm; childhood obesity; China; complication; growth, development and aging; newborn; prematurity; risk factor; Algorithms; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Machine Learning; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"

This study evaluated the safety and effect of fiber in ICU patients with gut microbiome sampling. Methods: This was a retrospective study nested within a prospective cohort. Adults were included if newly admitted to the ICU and could receive oral nutrition, enteral feedings, or no nutrition. Rectal swabs were performed at admission and 72 hours later. The primary exposure was fiber intake over 72 hours, classified in tertiles and adjusted for energy intake. The primary outcome was the relative abundance (RA) of SCFA producers via 16S RNA sequencing and the tolerability of fiber. Results: In 129 patients, median fiber intake was 13.4 g (interquartile range 0–35.4 g) over 72 hours. The high-fiber group had less abdominal distension (11% high fiber vs 28% no fiber, P <.01) and no increase in diarrhea (15% high fiber vs 13% no fiber, P =.94) or other adverse events. The median RA of SCFA producers after 72 hours was 0.40%, 0.50%, and 1.8% for the no-, low-, and high-fiber groups (P =.05 for trend). After correcting for energy intake, the median RA of SCFA producers was 0.41%, 0.32%, and 2.35% in the no-, low-, and high-corrected-fiber categories (P <.01). These associations remained significant after adjusting for clinical factors including antibiotics. Conclusions: During the 72 hours after ICU admission, fiber was well tolerated, and higher fiber intake was associated with more SCFA-producers. © 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition","critically ill; dietary fiber; gut microbiome; short-chain fatty acid","antibiotic agent; bacterial RNA; RNA 16S; short chain fatty acid; volatile fatty acid; abdominal distension; adult; adverse event; aged; Article; Blautia; caloric intake; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; critical illness; diarrhea; edema; enteric feeding; Enterococcus; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; female; high fiber diet; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; intestine examination; intestine flora; intestine infection; intestine obstruction; low fiber diet; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; microbial diversity; nausea and vomiting; nutrition; nutritional tolerance; population abundance; priority journal; rectum; retrospective study; RNA sequencing; bacterium; dietary fiber; prospective study; Adult; Bacteria; Cohort Studies; Critical Illness; Dietary Fiber; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Female; Humans; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies"

Current LAI estimation methods at subfield scale are limited not only by the characteristics of the spatial data (pixel size and spectral information) but also by the empiricity of developed models, mostly based on vegetation indices, which do not necessarily scale spatiality (among different varieties or planting characteristics) or temporally (need for different LAI models for different phenological stages). Widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms and high-resolution small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) information provide an opportunity for spatial and temporal LAI estimation addressing the spatial and temporal limitations. In this study, considering both accuracy and efficiency, a point-cloud-based feature-extraction approach (Full Approach) and a raster-based feature-extraction approach (Fast Approach) using sUAS information were developed based on multiple growing seasons (2014–2019) to extract and generate vine-scale information for LAI estimation in commercial vineyards across California. Three known ML algorithms, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), were considered, along with hybrid ML schemes based on those three algorithms, coupled with different feature-extraction approaches. Results showed that the hybrid ML technique using RF and RVM and the Fast Approach with 9 input variables, called RVM-RFFast model, performs better than others in a visual and statistical assessments of the generated LAI being also computationally efficient. Furthermore, using the generated LAI products in the quantification of energy balance using the two-source energy balance Priestley-Taylor version (TSEB-PT) model and EC tower data, the results indicated excellent estimation of net radiation (Rn) and latent heat flux (LE), good estimation of surface heat flux (G), and poor estimation of sensible heat flux (H). Additionally, TSEB-PT sensitivity analysis performed by regenerating LAI maps based on the generated LAI map (from − 15% of the original LAI map to + 15% with a 5% gap) showed that LAI uncertainty had a major impact on G, followed by evapotranspiration partitioning (T/ET), H, LE, and Rn. When considering the annual growth cycle of grapevines, the impact of LAI uncertainty on the T/ET in the veraison stage was larger than in the fruit set stage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Antennas; Decision trees; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Extraction; Machine learning; Reforestation; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; California; Features extraction; Hybrid machine learning; Index maps; Leaf Area Index; Machine learning algorithms; Random forests; Relevance Vector Machine; System information; Unmanned aerial systems; Feature extraction"

ET partitioning can also support the description of atmosphere and land interactions and provide unique insights into vegetation water status. Previous studies have identified leaf area index (LAI) estimation as a key descriptor of biomass conditions needed for the estimation of transpiration and evaporation. LAI estimation in clumped vegetation systems, such as vineyards and orchards, has proven challenging and is strongly related to crop phenological status and canopy management. In this study, a feature extraction model based on previous research was built to generate a total of 202 preliminary variables at a 3.6-by-3.6- meter-grid scale based on submeter-resolution information from a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) in four commercial vineyards across California. Using these variables, a machine learning model called eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was successfully built for LAI estimation. The XGBoost built-in function requires only six variables relating to vegetation indices and temperature to produce high-accuracy LAI estimation for the vineyard. Using the sixvariable XGBoost-based LAI map, two versions of the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, TSEB-PT and TSEB- 2T were used for energy balance and ET partitioning. Comparing these results with the Eddy-Covariance (EC) tower data, showed that TSEB-PT outperforms TSEB-2T on the estimation of sensible heat flux (within 13% relative error) and surface heat flux (within 34% relative error), while TSEB-2T outperforms TSEB-PT on the estimation of net radiation (within 14% relative error) and latent heat flux (within 2% relative error). For the mature vineyard (north block), TSEB-2T performs better than TSEB-PT in partitioning the canopy latent heat flux with 6.8% relative error and soil latent heat flux with 21.7% relative error; however, for the younger vineyard (south block), TSEB-PT performs better than TSEB-2T in partitioning the canopy latent heat flux with 11.7% relative error and soil latent heat flux with 39.3% relative error. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This article proposes to go a step forward in the use of AI in IoT, and proposes a novel approach within the Human-centric AI field for generating explanations about the knowledge learned by a neural network (in particular a multilayer perceptron) from IoT environments. More concretely, this work proposes two techniques based on the analysis of artificial neuron weights, and another technique aimed at explaining each estimation based on the analysis of training cases. This approach has been illustrated in the context of a smart IoT kitchen that detects the user depression based on the food used for each meal, using a simulator for this purpose.

The agricultural sector is one of the most affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water resources. An important phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation from water reservoirs, which implies a considerable amount of water lost during warmer periods of the year. Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks, obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to 0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the problem while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in it, which allows better understanding the problem and carrying out appropriate actions. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, using Kenya as the study area, we sought to identify the key drivers that affect greening and browning trends within the 4 main land cover types (agriculture, forest, grassland and shrubland) and within an area characterised by land cover change. The methodological approach used was the random forest classification algorithm, whereby the dependent variable was represented as 4 classes of NDVI greening and browning trends (strong browning, moderate browning, moderate greening, and strong greening). The explanatory variables (n = 28) were broadly grouped into 2 categories, natural and anthropogenic, and included a number of variables as proxies for broad socio-economic development. All models showed strong performance, and the mean values for accuracy and Kappa were 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Variables that repeatedly featured as the 5 most important variables across the datasets were: travel time to an urban area, distance to towns, distance to roads, distance to rivers, slope and vulnerability to climate change impacts. When the variables were grouped by SDGs, the results obtained showed that the variables grouped under the SDGs 15 (life on land), 8 (economic growth) and 13 (climate action) cumulatively accounted for approximately 80% of the prediction of the greening and browning trends. Our results raise the following considerations to enrich on-going and future policy and planning discussions aimed at addressing LDN: the implementation of LDN should be anchored on tried and tested SLM interventions; further analysis of the drivers of greening and browning trends should be undertaken at the sub-national level; integrated approaches that lead to greater alignment across multiple development priorities, including climate change, should be promoted; and targeted enforcement of environmental legislation is needed to deter processes and activities that are likely to lead to the degradation of land. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drivers; Kenya; Land degradation-neutrality; NDVI; Random forest",

For 13/14 sets of predictions, XGBoost or random forest outperformed deep learning models in prediction performance. Top ranked SNPs by F-score were identified from XGBoost, and with further investigation found overlap with significantly associated loci identified from GWAS and previous literature. Feature importance rankings were used to reduce marker input by up to 90%, and subsequent models maintained or improved their prediction performance. These findings support interpretable machine learning as an approach for genomic based prediction of traits in soybean and other crops. © 2022, The Author(s).","Feature selection; Genomic selection; Interpretable models; Machine learning; Soybean; XGBoost","genetics; genotype; machine learning; phenotype; soybean; Deep Learning; Genotype; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Soybeans"

In most cases, the image captured in the real-time scenario is subjected to added noise, distortion, poor lighting conditions, and other potential factors that results in poor model performance during the process of discriminating between normal and disease-affected samples. It eventually maximizes the margin of the error rate, thereby leading to misclassification of disease of different varieties of plants in the database with other categories. This paper presents an effective deep clustering-based plant disease categorization algorithm, Boosted-Deep Embedded Regularized Clustering (DEPICT). This model integrates the convolutional autoencoder model with locality-preserving constraints and group sparsity into the network, which improves the embedded learning representation of the images. The PlantVillage and PDD image databases are accessed to develop this model for maize crop. The images are segmented by eliminating the background, cropped, augmented before model training. The performance of the system is evaluated by clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information. The proposed Boosted-DEPICT exhibits better performance, attains promising results with an accuracy of 97.73% and 91.25% on PV and PDD datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep clustering algorithms. This system could be further enhanced by automating the entire process and transforming it into a mobile application for real-time analysis to gain instant results from any region. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Autoencoders; Boosted-DEPICT; Deep clustering; Image processing; Plant disease","Image enhancement; Learning systems; Clustering accuracy; Environmental conditions; Lighting conditions; Locality-preserving; Misclassifications; Mobile applications; Normalized mutual information; Real time analysis; Clustering algorithms"

The core of the proposed method is the division of the image being classified into separate rectangular parts, followed by the analysis of their influence on the classification result. Such divisions are repeated recursively until the explanation of the classification result is found, or the size of parts is too small. As a result, the pair of images with complement hidden parts is discovered, the first one of which preserves both the most valuable parts and the classification result of the initial image. The second image represents the result of hiding the most valuable parts of an initial image that leads to the different classification for the binary classification problem.

Methods: Firstly, the DenseNet-121 network is pre-trained on a large dataset of medical images without manual annotation using the comparison to learn (C2L) method to obtain a backbone network model containing more medical representations with training weights. Then, a global network is constructed by using global image learning to acquire an interpretable saliency map as attention mechanisms, which can generate a mask crop to get a local discriminant region. Thirdly, the local discriminant regions are used as local network inputs to obtain local features, and the global features are used with the local features by dimension in the pooling layer. Finally, a hash layer is added between the fully connected layer and the classification layer of the backbone network, defining classification loss, quantization loss and bit-balanced loss functions to generate high-quality hash codes. The final retrieval result is output by calculating the similarity metric of the hash codes. Results: Experiments on the Chest X-ray8 dataset demonstrate that our proposed interpretable saliency map can effectively locate focal regions, the fusion of features can avoid information omission, and the combination of three loss functions can generate more accurate hash codes. Compared with the current advanced medical image retrieval methods, this method can effectively improve the accuracy of medical image retrieval. Conclusions: The proposed hash retrieval approach combining interpretability and feature fusion can effectively improve the accuracy of medical image retrieval which can be potentially applied in computer-aided-diagnosis systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Attention mechanisms; Deep hashing; Feature fusion; Interpretability; Medical image retrieval","Computer aided diagnosis; Hash functions; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Image retrieval; Medical imaging; Search engines; Attention mechanisms; Back-bone network; Deep hashing; Features fusions; Image hash; Interpretability; Local feature; Medical image retrieval; Retrieval methods; Saliency map; Large dataset; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; deep learning; dimensionality reduction; disease classification; entropy; feature extraction; feature learning (machine learning); image retrieval; medical information; network learning; quantization; thorax radiography; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; factual database; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted"

Methods: We used data from adult HD patients treated at regional institutions of a global provider in Latin America (LatAm) and North America who contracted COVID-19 in 2020 before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available. Using 93 commonly captured variables, we developed machine learning models that predicted the likelihood of death overall, as well as during 0–14, 15–30, > 30 days after COVID-19 presentation and identified the importance of predictors. XGBoost models were built in parallel using the same programming with a 60%:20%:20% random split for training, validation, & testing data for the datasets from LatAm (Argentina, Columbia, Ecuador) and North America (United States) countries. Results: Among HD patients with COVID-19, 28.8% (1,001/3,473) died in LatAm and 20.5% (4,426/21,624) died in North America. Mortality occurred earlier in LatAm versus North America; 15.0% and 7.3% of patients died within 0–14 days, 7.9% and 4.6% of patients died within 15–30 days, and 5.9% and 8.6% of patients died > 30 days after COVID-19 presentation, respectively. Area under curve ranged from 0.73 to 0.83 across prediction models in both regions. Top predictors of death after COVID-19 consistently included older age, longer vintage, markers of poor nutrition and more inflammation in both regions at all timepoints. Unique patient attributes (higher BMI, male sex) were top predictors of mortality during 0–14 and 15–30 days after COVID-19, yet not mortality > 30 days after presentation. Conclusions: Findings showed distinct profiles of mortality in COVID-19 in LatAm and North America throughout 2020. Mortality rate was higher within 0–14 and 15–30 days after COVID-19 in LatAm, while mortality rate was higher in North America > 30 days after presentation. Nonetheless, a remarkable proportion of HD patients died > 30 days after COVID-19 presentation in both regions.

Automatic calculations of RSSR through computer vision technology have great significance for rice yield predictions. The basic premise for calculating RSSR is having an accurate and high throughput identification of rice grains. In this study, we propose a method based on image segmentation and deep learning to automatically identify rice grains and calculate RSSR. By collecting information on the rice panicle, our proposed image automatic segmentation method can detect the full grain and empty grain, after which the RSSR can be calculated by our proposed rice seed setting rate optimization algorithm (RSSROA). Finally, the proposed method was used to predict the RSSR during which process, the average identification accuracy reached 99.43%. This method has therefore been proven as an effective, non-invasive method for high throughput identification and calculation of RSSR. It is also applicable to soybean yields, as well as wheat and other crops with similar characteristics.

Taxonomy-aware colocations are important due to their use in taxonomy-reliant societal applications in ecology (e.g., finding new symbiotic relationships across food-chain), spatial pathology (e.g., immunotherapy for cancer), etc. Due to the taxonomy, the number of candidate patterns increases considerably (i.e., exponential in the number of colocated instances, where a subset of instances have a parent-child relation). Existing algorithms for mining general colocations are not designed to use taxonomy and will incur redundant computations across the hierarchy. We propose a taxonomy-aware colocation miner (TCM) algorithm which uses a user-defined taxonomy to find taxonomy-aware colocation patterns. We also propose TCM-Prune algorithm that prunes duplicate colocations instances having a parent-child relation. Experiments with synthetic and real data sets show that TCM and TCM-Prune can find colocation patterns missed by the traditional approach (i.e., the ones which do not take hierarchy into account), and TCM-Prune can remove duplicate colocation instances. © 2022 ACM.","colocation; pruning; taxonomy-aware pattern mining","Co-location patterns; Colocations; Feature types; Hierarchical taxonomy; Neighborhood relation; Pattern discovery; Pattern mining; Pruning; Spatial features; Taxonomy-aware pattern mining; Taxonomies"

The standard WMA models the linguistic information using type-1 (T1) fuzzy sets (FSs), which have a reduced capability to model the semantics of linguistic information. Therefore, we propose a novel Enhanced WMA, which models the linguistic information using the type-2 (T2) FSs. Further, our Enhanced T2 FS-based WMA can be modified to reflect the use of interval type-2 (IT2) FSs, for modelling linguistic uncertainty. IT2 FSs are suitable when better uncertainty handling capabilities are required compared to T1 FSs, however, at a computational cost lesser than the T2 FSs. Performance of Enhanced WMA is demonstrated through a real-world crop-yield prediction problem in smart agriculture and an additional exemplar application on users’ satisfaction ratings. Further, we have compared our approach with the performance obtained from the T1 FS-based WMA and the original estimations given in the original data. We found that our Enhanced WMA provides more precise estimates than the other two with 95% confidence level.

The objective of the European project WASTE2ROAD is to demonstrate the complete value chain from waste collection to engine tests. The principle of hydrothermal liquefaction is well known but there are still many factors that make the science very empirical. Most experiments in the literature are performed on batch reactors. Comparison of results from batch reactors with experiments with continuous reactors are rare in the literature. Methods: Various food wastes were transformed by hydrothermal liquefaction. The resources used and the products from the experiments have been extensively analysed. Two different experimental reactors have been used, a batch reactor and a continuous reactor. This paper presents a dataset of fully documented experiments performed in this project, on food wastes with different compositions, conditions and solvents. The data set is extended with data from the literature. The data was analysed using machine learning analysis and regression techniques. Results: This paper presents experimental results on various food wastes as well as modelling and analysis with machine learning algorithms. The experimental results were used to attempt to establish a link between batch and continuous experiments. The molecular weight of bio-oil from continuous experiments appear higher than that of batch experiments. This may be due to the configuration of our reactor. Conclusions: This paper shows how the use of regression models help with understanding the results, and the importance of process variables and resource composition. A novel data analysis technique gives an insight on the accuracy that can be obtained from these models. © 2022 Haarlemmer G and Roubaud A.","Bio-oil; Biochar; Biocrude; Biofuel; Food wastes; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Machine learning",

To date, efforts towards understanding complex non-linear interactions between AD operating parameters with ARG/MGE abundances rely on experimental investigations due to a lack of mechanistic models. Herein, three different machine learning (ML) algorithms, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were compared for their predictive capacities in simulating ARG/MGE abundance changes during AD. The models were trained and cross-validated using experimental data collected from 33 published literature. The comparison of model performance using coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean squared errors (RMSE) indicated that ANN was more reliable than RF and XGBoost. The mode of operation (batch/semi-continuous), co-digestion of food waste and sewage sludge, and residence time were identified as the three most critical features in predicting ARG/MGE abundance changes. Moreover, the trained ANN model could simulate non-linear interactions between operational parameters and ARG/MGE abundance changes that could be interpreted intuitively based on existing knowledge.

There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 &gt; 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available. Our findings highlight a potentially powerful tool to predict yield using multiple-source data and machine learning in other regions and for crops. © 2020 by the authors.","Google Earth Engine (GEE); Machine learning; Multi-source data; Triticum aestivum L.; Wheat yield prediction","Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Engines; Food supply; Forecasting; Random forests; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Different time windows; Gaussian process regression; Google earths; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Multisource data; Triticum aestivum L; Wheat yield; Learning systems"

However, difficulties in interpreting machine learning models and their predictions limit the confidence of using remote sensing images to detect lodging. In addition, the lodging datasets used for modeling are difficult to balance under natural conditions. Designing a robust and interpretable classification model for the detection of lodging in an imbalanced distribution dataset poses a particularly difficult challenge. In this study, visible and multi-spectral images were collected with a UAV to extract relevant features from remote sensing images. In a preliminary step, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) method were used to treat imbalanced datasets. The SMOTE-ENN-XGBoost model is proposed for the efficient identification of maize lodging at the plot scale. The SMOTE-ENN-XGBoost model achieved an F1-score of 0.930 and a recall of 0.899 on a testing set, suggesting that it can be used for modeling lodging detection. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was employed to interpret the identification and prioritization of features that determine lodging classification and activity prediction. The results showed that canopy structure and textural features are relatively stable compared with spectral features, which are susceptible to the external environment when modeling is employed to detect lodging. This work also showed that canopy structural, spectral, and textural information should be considered simultaneously rather than separately when detecting crop lodging in a crop breeding program in order to prevent differences in expression controlled by the interaction between genotype and environment obscuring the change in a single feature before and after lodging. For practical applications of machine learning models in crop lodging detection, such insights are of critical relevance. Taken together, the results of this study encourage further applications of remote sensing techniques to build interpretable machine learning models. © 2022","Lodging; Remote sensing; SHAP; SMOTE; XGBoost","Antennas; Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Lodging; Machine learning models; Nearest neighbors techniques; Nearest-neighbour; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Xgboost; Crops; data set; detection method; image analysis; image classification; maize; numerical model; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle"

In this work, a deep learning approach for identification of in-field diseased images of maize crop has been proposed. The images were captured from experimental fields of ICAR-IIMR, Ludhiana, India, targeted to three important diseases viz. Maydis Leaf Blight, Turcicum Leaf Blight and Banded Leaf and Sheath Blight in a non-destructive manner with varied backgrounds using digital cameras and smartphones. In order to solve the problem of class imbalance, artificial images were generated by rotation enhancement and brightness enhancement methods. In this study, three different architectures based on the framework of ‘Inception-v3’ network were trained with the collected diseased images of maize using baseline training approach. The best-performed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 95.99% with average recall of 95.96% on the separate test dataset. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the best-performing model with some pre-trained state-of-the-art models and presented the comparative results in this manuscript. The results reported that best-performing model performed quite better than the pre-trained models. This demonstrates the applicability of baseline training approach of the proposed model for better feature extraction and learning. Overall performance analysis suggested that the best-performed model is efficient in recognizing diseases of maize from in-field images even with varied backgrounds. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"crop; India; maize; Crops, Agricultural; Deep Learning; India; Zea mays"

However, global climate change and human activities have led to dramatic environmental changes severely affecting seagrass growth and development. Therefore, it is crucial to understand accurately how environmental changes, affect seagrass distribution. In this study, we selected the seagrass distribution area in Hainan, China, as the study area and proposed an ensemble model combining five machine learning models to predict the potential distribution of seagrass. Fifteen environmental variables were entered into the model, and the study results showed that the ensemble model provided the highest accuracy (Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.91). The environmental variables were then classified into regional and site explanations with the help of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. The difference in the contribution of regional and site environmental variables is demonstrated, and the model provides a more reasonable explanation for the site. The Shapley value (SHAP) and Partial dependency plot (PDP) analysis methods explain the importance of environmental variables in the seagrass distribution model and the effect of multiple environmental variable interactions on the prediction results, which implies opening the black box model for machine learning.

These models can be divided into two categories: global model and local model. The global model directly takes the whole leaf disease images as input to training and recognition. It can achieve end-to-end training and recognition, which is very convenient to use. But this kind of model cannot very accurately and completely extract the features from the very small diseased spots in the image. Before training and recognizing, the local model needs to extract the diseased spots part from the image by image segmentation technology. Then the local model takes the disease spots part images as input to training and recognition. Features extracted by local model are more accurate and complete. But this kind of model cannot achieve end-to-end training and recognition, and the image segmentation will bring additional overhead. Considering the disadvantage of global model and local model, we proposed a crop leaf disease image recognition method based on bilinear residual networks (named DIR-BiRN). DIR-BiRN extracts features by two residual networks feature extractors and then integrates the features by a bilinear pooling function. By this way, it can extract features more accurately and completely while achieving end-to-end training and recognition. Experiments on the PlantVillage dataset show that, when compared with the standard ResNet-18 model, the DIR-BiRN improves on accuracy performance, recall performance, precision performance, and F1-measure performance by averages of 0.2918, 0.81641, 0.59185, and 0.52151 percentage points, respectively. © 2022 Yun He et al.",,"Crops; Deep learning; Image segmentation; Crop leaves; End to end; Global models; Global-local; Images segmentations; Leaf disease; Learning models; Local model; Performance; Recognition methods; Image recognition"

The intelligent analysis, modeling, and management of agricultural and forest ecosystems, and of the use and protection of soils, already play important roles in securing our planet for future generations and will become irreplaceable in the future. Technical solutions must encompass the entire agricultural and forestry value chain. The process of digital transformation is supported by cyber-physical systems enabled by advances in ML, the availability of big data and increasing computing power. For certain tasks, algorithms today achieve performances that exceed human levels. The challenge is to use multimodal information fusion, i.e., to integrate data from different sources (sensor data, images, *omics), and explain to an expert why a certain result was achieved. However, ML models often react to even small changes, and disturbances can have dramatic effects on their results. Therefore, the use of AI in areas that matter to human life (agriculture, forestry, climate, health, etc.) has led to an increased need for trustworthy AI with two main components: explainability and robustness. One step toward making AI more robust is to leverage expert knowledge. For example, a farmer/forester in the loop can often bring in experience and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline—no AI can do this. Consequently, human-centered AI (HCAI) is a combination of “artificial intelligence” and “natural intelligence” to empower, amplify, and augment human performance, rather than replace people. To achieve practical success of HCAI in agriculture and forestry, this article identifies three important frontier research areas: (1) intelligent information fusion; (2) robotics and embodied intelligence; and (3) augmentation, explanation, and verification for trusted decision support. This goal will also require an agile, human-centered design approach for three generations (G). G1: Enabling easily realizable applications through immediate deployment of existing technology.

Unfortunately, especially with the most successful methods, the results are very difficult to comprehend by human experts. The application of AI in areas that impact human life (e.g., agriculture, climate, forestry, health, etc.) has therefore led to an demand for trust, which can be fostered if the methods can be interpreted and thus explained to humans. The research field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) provides the necessary foundations and methods. Historically, XAI has focused on the development of methods to explain the decisions and internal mechanisms of complex AI systems, with much initial research concentrating on explaining how convolutional neural networks produce image classification predictions by producing visualizations which highlight what input patterns are most influential in activating hidden units, or are most responsible for a model’s decision. In this volume, we summarize research that outlines and takes next steps towards a broader vision for explainable AI in moving beyond explaining classifiers via such methods, to include explaining other kinds of models (e.g., unsupervised and reinforcement learning models) via a diverse array of XAI techniques (e.g., question-and-answering systems, structured explanations). In addition, we also intend to move beyond simply providing model explanations to directly improving the transparency, efficiency and generalization ability of models. We hope this volume presents not only exciting research developments in explainable AI but also a guide for what next areas to focus on within this fascinating and highly relevant research field as we enter the second decade of the deep learning revolution.

This is of great importance in virtually all critical domains where we suffer from low data quality, i.e. we do not have the expected i.i.d. data. Therefore, the use of AI in domains that impact human life (agriculture, climate, health,..) has led to an increased demand for trustworthy AI. Explainability is now even mandatory due to regulatory requirements in sensitive domains such as medicine, which requires traceability, transparency and interpretability capabilities. One possible step to make AI more robust is to combine statistical learning with knowledge representations. For certain tasks, it can be advantageous to use a human in the loop. A human expert can - sometimes, of course not always - bring experience, domain knowledge and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline. Such approaches are not only a solution from a legal point of view, but in many application areas the “why” is often more important than a pure classification result. Consequently, both explainability and robustness can promote reliability and trust and ensure that humans remain in control, thus complementing human intelligence with artificial intelligence. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Explainable AI; Human-in-the-loop; Robustness; Trust","Domain Knowledge; Machine learning; Robustness (control systems); Computing power; Explainable artificial intelligence; Human levels; Human-in-the-loop; Large amounts; Performance; Robustness; Statistical machine learning; Training data; Trust; Knowledge representation"

The potential of AI to benefit humanity and its environment is undeniably enormous. AI can definitely help find new solutions to the most pressing challenges facing our human society in virtually all areas of life: from agriculture and forest ecosystems that affect our entire planet, to the health of every single human being. However, this article highlights a very different aspect. For all its benefits, the large-scale adoption of AI technologies also holds enormous and unimagined potential for new kinds of unforeseen threats. Therefore, all stakeholders, governments, policy makers, and industry, together with academia, must ensure that AI is developed with these potential threats in mind and that the safety, traceability, transparency, explainability, validity, and verifiability of AI applications in our everyday lives are ensured. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure the use of trustworthy and ethically reliable AI and to avoid the misuse of AI technologies. Achieving this will require a concerted effort to ensure that AI is always consistent with human values and includes a future that is safe in every way for all people on this planet.

A human-centric artificial intelligence-based probabilistic approach is used in this paper to perform a unified analysis of data from the Global Food Security Index (GFSI). The significance of this intuitive probabilistic reasoning approach for predictive forecasting lies in its simplicity and user-friendliness to people who may not be trained in classical computer science or in software programming. In this approach, predictive modeling using a counterfactual probabilistic reasoning analysis of the GFSI dataset can be utilized to reveal the interplay and tensions between the variables that underlie food affordability, food availability, food quality and safety, and the resilience of natural resources. Exemplars are provided in this paper to illustrate how computational simulations can be used to produce forecasts of good and bad conditions in food security using multi-variant optimizations.

However, poor seasonal and regional adaptabilities and low cooling power density of the RC technology confine its effective applications only in hot seasons and regions with RC-friendly ambient conditions. Similarly, a solar thermal collector cannot work at night and is of little value when heat is needless. To tackle these challenges, a hybrid solar photothermic and radiative cooling (PT-RC) collector equipped with a rotatable absorber/emitter panel is proposed and experimentally investigated. This dual-mode collector can flexibly switch between PT and RC to match specific energy demands in different scenarios. The daily solar thermal efficiency of the PT-RC system at zero-reduced temperature reached 50.4%, a typical level of flat-plate solar water heating systems. The PT-RC system could not provide cooling energy during most daytime hours. However, the system could easily achieve nighttime cooling, with the cooling power of the collector decreasing from about 60 to 50 W/m2 as the circulated water being continuously cooled down from around 20 to 12 °C. The average nocturnal cooling power of the PT-RC collector ranged from 30.5 to 57.5 W/m2 in a multi-night RC test. This rotatable PT-RC collector offers a new strategy to flexibly deliver heat and coldness in a renewable and environmental-friendly manner and shows the potential of smart thermal management in buildings, vehicles, agriculture, etc. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Passive cooling; Radiative cooling; Rotatable; Solar collector; Solar energy","Meteorology; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Cooling power; Cooling power density; Cooling scheme; Cooling technology; Outer space; Passive cooling; Photothermics; Radiative cooling; Radiative cooling system; Rotatable; Solar energy; ambient air; cooling; energy flux; heating; solar power; temperature effect"

However, limited studies have built forecasting models based on large-scale MDLD-based population inflow time series. This task is challenging due to complex nonlinear temporal dynamics, high-dimensional time series structure (i.e. multiple time series with multi-shape inputs and outputs), and non-negligible impacts from various external factors. To address these challenges, this study introduces a deep learning framework, the Interpretable Hierarchical Transformer (IHTF), for nationwide county-level population inflow time series forecasting and interpretation. A variety of cutting-edge deep learning techniques are fused, including the variable selection network to incorporate external effects, the gated residual network to handle nonlinearity, and the transformer architecture to learn temporal dynamics. Different interior parameters, such as variable selection weight and temporal attention weight, are extracted to explain patterns learned by the framework. Numerical experiments show that IHTF outperforms extensive baseline models in forecasting accuracy. In addition, feature importance generated by IHTF is similar to the tree-based model, LightGBM, but exhibits a more even distribution, among which point-of-interests (POIs) count, county location, median household income, and percentage of accommodation and food services are the most important static variables. Moreover, attention weight demonstrates that IHTF can automatically learn the seasonality from time series. Taken together, this framework can serve as a reliable travel demand forecasting component in the transportation planning process that allows modeling the travel demand continuously instead of by snapshot. © 2022","Crowd flow; Human mobility; Interpretability; Mobile device location data; Time series forecasting; Transformer","Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Location; Population statistics; Crowd flows; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Human mobility; Inflow time series; Interpretability; Location data; Mobile device location data; Time series forecasting; Transformer; Time series; experimental study; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; transportation planning; travel demand"

There exist different ways, including physical-based and data-driven approaches, to estimate evapotranspiration. Here, the physical-based model (the surface energy balance system, SEBS), data-driven models (using three machine learning techniques, deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF), and symbolic regression (SR)), and hybrid model were compared using the FLUXNET2015 dataset. More importantly, different search strategies were investigated to optimize the network architecture and to explore the maximum accuracy of data-driven models. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was introduced to quantify the contributions of input features to evapotranspiration estimation. The results show that there is a large error in the SEBS model with RMSE of 121 W m−2, while the data-driven models acquire the best evapotranspiration estimation with RMSE of 32–53 W m−2. The hybrid approach, whose RMSE is 60 W m−2, improves the SEBS model but still underperforms data-driven models. The complexity of data-driven models influences the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimations. By optimizing the network architecture, DNN and RF obtain results with similar precision. But the performance of SR, which generates a simple algebraic formula for evapotranspiration estimation, is significantly degraded. SHAP reveals that all models regard net radiation as the most crucial feature. The SEBS and hybrid models attach much importance to temperature and humidity. Three data-driven models learn the different relationships between input features and evapotranspiration. The DNN-based model is likely to learn a relatively correct relationship among the data-driven models because it has a similar feature importances pattern with physical-based and hybrid models. © 2021","Data-driven; Evapotranspiration; Hybrid modeling; Physical-based","Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Network architecture; Data driven; Data driven modelling; Hybrid modelling; Neural-networks; Physical based modeling; Physical-based; Random forests; Surface energy balance systems; Symbolic regression; Systems modelling; Deep neural networks; accuracy assessment; comparative study; energy balance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; numerical model; physical analysis"

The field of yield prediction is currently dominated by Deep Learning approaches. While the accuracies reached with those approaches are promising, the needed amounts of data and the “black-box” nature can restrict the application of Deep Learning methods.

We aimed to compare the effects of a low-glycemic diet representing the Korean traditional balanced diet (Low-GID) and westernized diet as a control diet (CD) on anthropometry, serum metabolites, and fecal bacteria in a randomized clinical trial according to enterotypes. We recruited 52 obese women aged 30–50 years, and they consumed Low-GID and CD meals for 1 month, with a 1-month washout period, in a crossover randomized clinical trial. The Low-GID was mainly composed of whole grains with fish, vegetables, seaweeds, and perilla oil, whereas CD contained refined rice, bread, noodles, meats, and processed foods. Serum lipid profiles, metabolomics, serum short-chain fatty acids, and fecal bacteria were analyzed. The important variables influenced by Low-GID and CD were determined by SHAP value in the XGBoost algorithm according to Bacteroides (ET-B) and Prevotella (ET-P). Low-GID and CD interventions did not change the enterotypes, but they modified serum metabolites and some fecal bacterial species differently according to enterotypes. The 10-fold cross-validation of the XGBoost classifier in the ET-P and ET-B clusters was 0.91 ± 0.04 and 0.8 ± 0.07, respectively. In the ET-P cluster, serum L-homocysteine, glutamate, leucine concentrations, and muscle mass were higher in the CD group than in the Low-GID group, whereas serum 3-hydroxybutyric acid concentration was significantly higher in the Low-GID group than in the CD group (p < 0.05). In fecal bacteria, Gemmiger formicilis, Collinsella aerofaciens, and Escherichia coli were higher in the CD group than in the Low-GID group. In the ET-B cohort, serum tryptophan and total cholesterol concentrations were higher in the CD group than in the Low-GID group, whereas serum glutathione and 3-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations were significantly higher in the Low-GID group than in the CD group (p < 0.05). However, Bifidobacterium longum was higher in CD than Low-GID in the ET-B cluster, but serum butyric acid levels were higher in the Low-GID than in the CD group. In conclusion, Low-GID can be recommended in obese women with both ET-P and ET-B enterotypes, although its efficacy was more effective in ET-P.

To achieve this goal, a prediction rice yield model was constructed, based on soil data, remote sensing data (optical and radar), climatic data, and farming practices. The dataset was collected from a rice crop surface of 89.2 ha cultivated continuously for a 5-year period and was analyzed with machine learning (ML) systems. A variational autoencoder (VAE) for reconstructing the input data of the prediction model was applied, resulting in MAE of 0.6 tn/ha, with an average yield for the study fields and period measured at 9.6 tn/ha. VAE learns the original input data representation and transforms them in a latent feature space, so that the anomalies and the discrepancies of the data are reduced. The reconstructed data by VAE provided a more sophisticated and detailed ML model, improving our knowledge about the various correlations between soil, N management parameters, and yield. Both optical and radar imagery and the climatic data were found to be of high importance for the model, as indicated by the application of XAI (explainable artificial intelligence) techniques.

VvGLPs showed similarity in the overall structure, shape, and position of the cupin domain. Functionally, VvGLPs control and regulate the production of secondary metabolites to cope with various stresses.

Although previous approaches have proven to be promising, they are limited, especially in real-life scenarios, to properly diagnose and characterize the problem. In this work, we propose a framework which besides recognizing and localizing various plant abnormalities also informs the user about the severity of the diseases infecting the plant. By taking a single image as input, our algorithm is able to generate detailed descriptive phrases (user-defined) that display the location, severity stage, and visual attributes of all the abnormalities that are present in the image. Our framework is composed of three main components. One of them is a detector that accurately and efficiently recognizes and localizes the abnormalities in plants by extracting region-based anomaly features using a deep neural network-based feature extractor. The second one is an encoder–decoder network that performs pixel-level analysis to generate abnormality-specific severity levels. Lastly is an integration unit which aggregates the information of these units and assigns unique IDs to all the detected anomaly instances, thus generating descriptive sentences describing the location, severity, and class of anomalies infecting plants. We discuss two possible ways of utilizing the abovementioned units in a single framework. We evaluate and analyze the efficacy of both approaches on newly constructed diverse paprika disease and pest recognition datasets, comprising six anomaly categories along with 11 different severity levels. Our algorithm achieves mean average precision of 91.7% for the abnormality detection task and a mean panoptic quality score of 70.78% for severity level prediction.

Two of these IT interfaces relate to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT). While AI focuses on providing a “human” garb for computing devices, thereby making them “intelligent” devices, IoT relies on interfaces between sensors and the environment to make “intelligent” decisions. Recently, the convergence of AI and IoT – also referred to as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) – is seen as a real opportunity to refurbish the public service delivery formats. However, there is limited understanding as to how AIoT could contribute to the improvisation of public service delivery. This study aims to create a modular framework for AIoT in addition to highlighting the drivers and barriers for its integration in the public sector. Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive-explanatory study takes a qualitative approach. It entails a thorough examination of the drivers and barriers of integrating AI and IoT in the public sector. A review of literature has led to the development of a conceptual framework outlining the various factors that contribute to creating public value. Findings: Value creation occurs when AI and IoT coalesce in the public service delivery mechanisms. Originality/value: AIoT is a cutting-edge technology revolutionizing health care, agriculture, infrastructure and all other industrial domains.

New data streams (""big data"") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of ""new""modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine ""old""and ""new""modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem.

One of the most important challenges in data gathering and examining accurate data is “energy consumption.” However, continuously changing environmental conditions, mobility in devices and extreme resource usage, such as battery capacity in WSNs collectively contribute to a high possibility of redundant data transmission thus making it tremendously hard to achieve a satisfactory network lifetime. Additionally, these environmental monitoring applications periodically senses and aggregate data which usually exhibits high temporal and spatial redundancies. As a result, exploiting these redundancies is essential for both resource utilization, as well as accurate data transmission. Since a huge amount of energy is exhausted in transmitting the redundant data, which has become a bottleneck in scaling such applications. In this context, this article provides a thorough examination of existing energy-efficient redundant data transmission reduction techniques, as well as their strengths and drawbacks. The idea of redundant data transmission reduction concept is divided into three stages: the sensor nodes (SN) at the first stage, the cluster heads (CHs) at the second stage, and the base station (BS) at the third stage. Furthermore, this survey focuses on the current issues and challenges, as well as the future directions in reducing redundant data transmission for future investigation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Climate change; Data communication systems; Data reduction; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Redundancy; Sensor nodes; Surveys; Volcanoes; Data gathering; Data-transmission; Energy-consumption; Environmental conditions; Glacier melting; Network lifetime; Reduction techniques; Redundant data; Transmission reduction; Volcanic eruptions; Energy utilization"

Using “take-out food” as a keyword, 18,544 search results were found in 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak, compared to 20,718 search results in 2021. These keywords were analyzed using text mining, semantic network analysis, CONCOR analysis, and sentiment analysis, respectively, to understand consumers’ perception of take-out food. Using text mining, in 2019, “dining-out” was the most frequent search term associated with take-out food, followed by packing, famous restaurant, family, delicious, menu, and available. In 2021, “dining-out” was again the most popular keyword, followed by packing, famous restaurant, delivery, family, delicious, available, and Corona. A semantic network analysis showed that, in 2019, four categories emerged: delicious, meat, satisfaction, and lunchbox. The same analysis showed that, in 2021, the categories were delicious, meat, good, and home meal. These findings suggest that, after COVID-19, take-out food began to be recognized as a daily meal that can replace home-cooked meals. According to the sentiment analysis, the number of positive keywords decreased by 4.03% after COVID-19, while the number of negative keywords increased at the same rate; regarding the increase in negative keywords, such as sadness, disgust, and fear, since the emergence of COVID-19, consumers’ anxiety about eating out due to the virus was observed. This study can be useful by providing core data and an analysis method necessary for food service companies’ business activities and decision making related to take-out amid consumers’ rapidly changing needs for the dining-out environment caused by COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.","big data; COVID-19; dining-out; social media; take-out","decision making; perception"

This study identified words closely associated with the keyword “food delivery” based on big data from social media and investigated consumers’ perceptions of and needs for food delivery and related issues before and after COVID-19. Results were derived through analysis methods such as text mining analysis, Concor analysis, and sentiment analysis. The research findings can be summarized as follows: In 2019, frequently appearing dining-related words were “dining-out,” “delivery,” “famous restaurant,” “delivery food,” “foundation,” “dish,” “family order,” and “delicious.” In 2021, these words were “delivery,” “delivery food,” “famous restaurant,” “foundation,” “COVID-19,” “dish,” “order,” “application,” and “family.” The analysis results for the food delivery sentimental network based on 2019 data revealed discourses revolving around delicious, delivery food, lunch box, and Korean food. For the 2021 data, discourses revolved around delivery food, recommend, and delicious. The emotional analysis, which extracted positive and negative words from the “food delivery” search word data, demonstrated that the number of positive keywords decreased by 2.85%, while negative keywords increased at the same rate. In addition, compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era, a weakening trend in positive emotions and an increasing trend in negative emotions were detected after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; sub-emotions under the positive category (e.g., good feelings, joy, interest) decreased in 2021 compared to 2019, whereas sub-emotions under the negative category (e.g., sadness, fear, pain) increased. © 2022 by the authors.","big data; COVID-19 pandemic; dining out trend; food delivery; social media",

In this study, a robust AcoD model for biogas prediction is developed using deep learning (DL). We propose a hybrid DL architecture, i.e., DA–LSTM–VSN, wherein a dual-stage-attention (DA)-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network is integrated with variable selection networks (VSNs). To enhance the model predictability, we perform hyperparameter optimization. The model accuracy is validated using long-term AcoD monitoring data measured over two years of municipal wastewater treatment plant operation and then compared with those of two other DL-based models (i.e., DA–LSTM and the standard LSTM). In addition, the feature importance (FI) is analyzed to investigate the relative contribution of input variables to biogas production prediction. Finally, we demonstrate the successful application of the validated DL model to the AcoD process optimization. Results show that the model accuracy improved significantly by incorporating DA into LSTM, i.e., the coefficient of determination (R2) increased from 0.38 to 0.68; however, the R2 can be further increased to 0.76 by combining DA–LSTM with a VSN. For the biogas prediction of the AcoD model, the VSN contributes significantly by employing the discontinuous time series of measurement data on biodegradable organic-associated variables during AcoD. In addition, the VSN allows the AcoD model to be interpretable via FI analysis using its weighted input features. The FI results show that the relative importance is vital to variables associated with food waste leachate, whereas it is marginal for those associated with the primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges. In conclusion, the AcoD model proposed herein can be utilized in practical applications as a robust tool because it can provide the optimal sludge conditions to improve biogas production. This is because it facilitates the time-series biogas prediction at the full scale using unprocessed datasets with either missing value imputation or outlier removal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic co-digestion; Biogas; Deep learning; Model-based process optimization; Modeling and prediction","Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Optimization; Process control; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Time series; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic co-digestion; Biogas production; Deep learning; Digestion models; Dual stage; Model-based OPC; Model-based process optimization; Modelling and predictions; Process optimisation; Variables selections; Biogas; biogas; biofuel; methane; anaerobic digestion; biogas; machine learning; numerical model; organic pollutant; prediction; waste technology; wastewater treatment; accuracy; anaerobic digestion; Article; biofuel production; controlled study; deep learning; food waste; hybrid; leaching; long short term memory network; organic waste; prediction; process optimization; sedimentation; sludge; standard; time series analysis; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; digestion; food; sewage; waste disposal; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Deep Learning; Digestion; Food; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Sewage"

However, most of them focus on clinical medicine and few on understanding the spatial dynamics of the high-risk population for transmission of COVID-19 in real-world settings. This study aims to investigate the association between population features and COVID-19 transmission risk in Hong Kong, which can help guide the allocation of medical resources and the implementation of preventative measures to control the spread of the pandemic. First, we built machine learning models to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on the population features of different tertiary planning units (TPUs). Then, we analyzed the distribution of cases and the prediction results to find specific characteristics of TPUs leading to large-scale outbreaks of COVID-19. We further evaluated the importance and influence of various population features on the prediction results using SHAP values to identify indicators for high-risk populations for COVID-19 transmission. The evaluation of COVID-19 cases and the TPU dataset in Hong Kong shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Medical nutrition therapy is often forgotten by patients for several reasons, such as difficulty determining the right nutritional pattern for themselves, regulating their daily nutritional patterns, or even not heeding nutritional diet recommendations given by doctors. Management of nutritional therapy is one of the important efforts that can be made by diabetic patients to prevent an increase in the complexity of the disease. Setting a diet with proper nutrition will help patients manage a healthy diet. The development of Smart Plate Health to Eat is a technological innovation that helps patients and users know the type of food, weight, and nutrients contained in certain foods. This study involved 50 types of food with a total of 30,800 foods using the YOLOv5s algorithm, where the identification, measurement of weight, and nutrition of food were investigated using a Chenbo load cell weight sensor (1 kg), an HX711 weight weighing A/D module pressure sensor, and an IMX219-160 camera module (waveshare).

Especially in grape production, the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions are of great interest, and they may be utilized for both fruit monitoring and quality control at all stages of maturity. The aim of this work was the quantitative estimation of the wine grape ripeness, for four different grape varieties, by using a highly accurate contact probe spectrometer that covers the entire VNIR–SWIR spectrum (350–2500 nm). The four varieties under examination were Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah and all the samples were collected over the 2020 and 2021 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages (corresponding to stages 81 through 89 of the BBCH scale) from the vineyard of Ktima Gerovassiliou located in Northern Greece. All measurements were performed in situ and a refractometer was used to measure the total soluble solids content (°Brix) of the grapes, providing the ground truth data. After the development of the grape spectra library, four different machine learning algorithms, namely Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), coupled with several pre-treatment methods were applied for the prediction of the °Brix content from the VNIR–SWIR hyperspectral data. The performance of the different models was evaluated using a cross-validation strategy with three metrics, namely the coefficient of the determination ((Formula presented.)), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ). High accuracy was achieved for Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah from the best models developed using the CNN learning algorithm ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.)), while a good fit was attained for the Chardonnay variety from SVR ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.)), proving that by using a portable spectrometer the in situ estimation of the wine grape maturity could be provided. The proposed methodology could be a valuable tool for wine producers making real-time decisions on harvest time and with a non-destructive way. © 2023 by the authors.","cultivar; deep learning; NIR spectroscopy; oenological parameters; TSS; vineyard; vis–NIR","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forestry; Fruits; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Learning algorithms; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Near infrared spectroscopy; Quality control; Spectrometers; Support vector regression; Cultivar; Deep learning; NIR spectroscopy; Oenological parameters; Short wave infrared; TSS; Vineyard; Visible and near infrared; Vis–NIR; Wine grapes; Wine; carbohydrate; artificial intelligence; chemistry; fruit; near infrared spectroscopy; procedures; Vitis; wine; Artificial Intelligence; Carbohydrates; Fruit; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Sugars; Vitis; Wine"

Understanding how land-use and climate factors interact is critical to predicting and managing pollinator populations and ensuring adequate pollination services, but most studies have evaluated either land-use or climate effects, not both. Furthermore, bee species are incredibly variable, spanning an array of behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits that can increase or decrease resilience to land-use or climate change. Thus, there are likely bee species that benefit, while others suffer, from changing climate and land use, but few studies have documented taxon-specific trends. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we analyzed a long-term dataset of wild bee occurrences from Maryland, Delaware, and Washington DC, USA, examining how different bee genera and functional groups respond to landscape composition, quality, and climate factors. Despite a large body of literature documenting land-use effects on wild bees, in this study, climate factors emerged as the main drivers of wild-bee abundance and richness. For wild-bee communities in spring and summer/fall, temperature and precipitation were more important predictors than landscape composition, landscape quality, or topography. However, relationships varied substantially between wild-bee genera and functional groups. In the Northeast USA, past trends and future predictions show a changing climate with warmer winters, more intense precipitation in winter and spring, and longer growing seasons with higher maximum temperatures. In almost all of our analyses, these conditions were associated with lower abundance of wild bees. Wild-bee richness results were more mixed, including neutral and positive relationships with predicted temperature and precipitation patterns. Thus, in this region and undoubtedly more broadly, changing climate poses a significant threat to wild-bee communities. © 2021 The Authors.

Plant diseases can have a devastating influence towards food safety and a considerable loss in the production of agricultural products. Disease identification on the plant is essential for long‐term agriculture sus-tainability. Manually monitoring plant diseases is difficult due to time limitations and the diversity of diseases. In the realm of agricultural inputs, automatic characterization of plant diseases is widely required. Based on performance out of all image‐processing methods, is better suited for solving this task. This work investigates plant diseases in grapevines. Leaf blight, Black rot, stable, and Black measles are the four types of diseases found in grape plants. Several earlier research proposals using machine learning algorithms were created to detect one or two diseases in grape plant leaves; no one offers a complete detection of all four diseases. The photos are taken from the plant village dataset in order to use transfer learning to retrain the EfficientNet B7 deep architecture. Following the transfer learning, the collected features are down‐sampled using a Logistic Regression tech-nique. Finally, the most discriminant traits are identified with the highest constant accuracy of 98.7% using state‐of‐the‐art classifiers after 92 epochs. Based on the simulation findings, an appropriate classifier for this application is also suggested.

However, this aspect is rarely studied in the existing literature. Hence, the current study aimed to evaluate the contribution of view and illumination geometries to the accuracy of retrieving Leaf Chlorophyll a and b (LCab), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) using the Random Forest (RF). The experiments were performed on various input variable scenarios where per-pixel geometric covariates, i.e. View and Sun Zenith Angles (VZA and SZA, respectively), and Relative Azimuth Angle (RAA), are excluded and included in spectral bands (SB) and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), respectively, in two semi-arid areas. The results showed that spectral bands or vegetation indices combined with geometric covariates improved the R 2 by 10–15% for LAI and 3–5% for CCC. In contrast, negligible improvements of 1–2% were achieved for LCab with cross-validation test data and independent held-out dataset, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, VZA and SZA were among the topmost influential variables in the RF models for estimating LAI, LCab, and CCC. Collectively, per-pixel geometric variables explained more than 30% of the variability in surface reflectance for all Sentinel-2 spectral bands (p &lt; 2.2e-16). Overall, the results showed that incorporating geometric covariates improved the accuracy of retrieving BVs; thus, it provided additional information that improves the predictive power of SB and SVIs. The significant benefits of the geometric variables were mainly realized for canopy-level BVs (i.e. LAI and CCC) than for LCab. Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate per-pixel view and illumination geometry in estimating LAI and CCC, especially when using wide-view sensors such as Sentinel-2. However, further testing in different phenology, site and acquisition conditions is needed to confirm the contribution of the geometric covariates to facilitate reliable retrieval of BVs from remotely sensed data and aid better agronomic decisions. © 2023 The Author(s).

In the changing climate, farmers in developing countries must adopt technologies and farming practices such as precision agriculture (PA). PA-based approaches enable farmers to cope with frequent and intensified droughts and heatwaves, optimising yields, increasing efficiencies, and reducing operational costs. Biophysical parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCab), and Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) are essential for characterising field-level spatial variability and thus are necessary for enabling variable rate application technologies, precision irrigation, and crop monitoring. Moreover, robust machine learning algorithms offer prospects for improving the estimation of biophysical parameters due to their capability to deal with non-linear data, small samples, and noisy variables. This study compared the predictive performance of sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) for estimating LAI, LCab, and CCC with Sentinel-2 imagery in Bothaville, South Africa and identified, using variable importance measures, the most influential bands for estimating crop biophysical parameters. The results showed that RF was superior in estimating all three biophysical parameters, followed by GBM which was better in estimating LAI and CCC, but not LCab, where sPLS was relatively better. Since all biophysical parameters could be achieved with RF, it can be considered a good contender for operationalisation. Overall, the findings in this study are significant for future biophysical product development using RF to reduce reliance on many algorithms for specific parameters, thus facilitating the rapid extraction of actionable information to support PA and crop monitoring activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Evapotranspiration (ET) by FAO-56 Penman-Monteith standard method is complex, especially for saline soils. Moreover, existing studies focus on the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning-enabled smart and precision irrigation water recommendation systems along with the ET estimation by limited parameters. The ETs for saline soils are also equally important for the reclamation of saline soils, which is ignored by the existing literature. The study proposed IoT and machine leaching-based architecture of context-aware monthly ETs estimations for saline soil reclamation with the effective leaching process. The IoT-enabled crop field contexts in terms of crop field temperature, soil salinity, and irrigation water salinity are used as input features to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ensembled LSTM models for monthly ETs predictions. The performance of the proposed solution is observed in terms of the accuracy of the machine learning models along with the comparison against the FAO-56 PM-based standard method. The implementation of the proposed solution reveals that the ensembled LSTM-based approach for ETs is more accurate as compared to the LSTM model with accuracies of 92 and 90% for the training and validation datasets, respectively. The predictions made by the ensembled LSTM are more in line with the FAO-56 PM-based method with a Pearson correlation of 0.916 as compared to LSTM models. The implementation of the proposed solution in real-time environments reveals that the proposed solution is more effective in reducing the soil salinity as compared to the traditional method. © 2013 IEEE.","ensembled LSTM; Evapotranspiration (ET); evapotranspiration for saline soils (ETs); FAO-56 Penman-Monteith; leaching process; long short-term memory model (LSTM); saline soil","Brain; Correlation methods; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Internet of things; Leaching; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Saline water; Soils; Water conservation; Water supply; Ensembled long short-term memory model; Evapotranspiration; Evapotranspiration for saline soil (ET); FAO-56 penman-monteith; Leaching; Leaching process; Long short-term memory model; Memory modeling; Penman Monteith; Saline soil; Salinity (geophysical); Soil measurement; Irrigation"

Particularly, maternal and neonatal morbidity due to various non-communicable and nutrition related diseases is a serious public health issue that leads to several deaths every year. These diseases affecting either mother or child can be hospital-acquired, contracted during pregnancy or delivery, postpartum and even during child growth and development. Many of these conditions are challenging to detect at their early stages, which puts the patient at risk of developing severe conditions over time. Therefore, there is a need for early screening, detection and diagnosis, which could reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), digital technologies have emerged as practical assistive tools in different healthcare sectors but are still in their nascent stages when applied to maternal and neonatal health. This review article presents an in-depth examination of digital solutions proposed for maternal and neonatal healthcare in low resource settings and discusses the open problems as well as future research directions.

Advances in crop phenomics, enviromics, together with the other “omics” approaches are paving ways for elucidating the detailed complex biological mechanisms that motivate crop functions in response to environmental trepidations. These “omics” approaches have provided plant researchers with precise tools to evaluate the important agronomic traits for larger-sized germplasm at a reduced time interval in the early growth stages. However, the big data and the complex relationships within impede the understanding of the complex mechanisms behind genes driving the agronomic-trait formations. AI brings huge computational power and many new tools and strategies for future breeding. The present review will encompass how applications of AI technology, utilized for current breeding practice, assist to solve the problem in high-throughput phenotyping and gene functional analysis, and how advances in AI technologies bring new opportunities for future breeding, to make envirotyping data widely utilized in breeding. Furthermore, in the current breeding methods, linking genotype to phenotype remains a massive challenge and impedes the optimal application of high-throughput field phenotyping, genomics, and enviromics. In this review, we elaborate on how AI will be the preferred tool to increase the accuracy in high-throughput crop phenotyping, genotyping, and envirotyping data; moreover, we explore the developing approaches and challenges for multiomics big computing data integration.

Despite increased mobile interventions for obesity, there are lost opportunities to achieve better outcomes due to the lack of a predictive model using current existing longitudinal and cross-sectional health data. Noom (Noom Inc) is a mobile app that provides various lifestyle-related logs including food logging, exercise logging, and weight logging. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a weight change predictive model using an interpretable artificial intelligence algorithm for mobile-based interventions and to explore contributing factors to weight loss. Methods: Lifelog mobile app (Noom) user data of individuals who used the weight loss program for 16 weeks in the United States were used to develop an interpretable recurrent neural network algorithm for weight prediction that considers both time-variant and time-fixed variables. From a total of 93, 696 users in the coaching program, we excluded users who did not take part in the 16-week weight loss program or who were not overweight or obese or had not entered weight or meal records for the entire 16-week program. This interpretable model was trained and validated with 5-fold cross-validation (training set: 70%; testing: 30%) using the lifelog data. Mean absolute percentage error between actual weight loss and predicted weight was used to measure model performance. To better understand the behavior factors contributing to weight loss or gain, we calculated contribution coefficients in test sets. Results: A total of 17, 867 users' data were included in the analysis. The overall mean absolute percentage error of the model was 3.50%, and the error of the model declined from 3.78% to 3.45% by the end of the program. The time-level attention weighting was shown to be equally distributed at 0.0625 each week, but this gradually decreased (from 0.0626 to 0.0624) as it approached 16 weeks. Factors such as usage pattern, weight input frequency, meal input adherence, exercise, and sharp decreases in weight trajectories had negative contribution coefficients of -0.021, -0.032, -0.015, and -0.066, respectively. For time-fixed variables, being male had a contribution coefficient of -0.091. Conclusions: An interpretable algorithm, with both time-variant and time-fixed data, was used to precisely predict weight loss while preserving model transparency. This week-to-week prediction model is expected to improve weight loss and provide a global explanation of contributing factors, leading to better outcomes. © 2021 JMIR Publications.

Because tile-drained crop production systems in the Midwestern United States are one of the single largest contributors to environmental degradation, we explored alternative tile drain configurations by changing the tile spacing and depth of tile-drained fields in central Illinois and then by evaluating comprehensively the impacts of different tile drain configurations on crop productivity and environmental sustainability using the Root Zone Water Quality Model 2 (RZWQM2). An analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool, was used to evaluate the optimum tile spacing and depth scenario. The model simulations and AHP tested three management schemes designated as “agricultural productivity” (AP), “environmental sustainability” (ES), and “advance in technology” (AT). The schemes were designed based on three criteria: operational cost, crop profit, and environmental control. Analysis showed that deeper tiles and narrower tile spacing resulted in decreases in flow and nitrate loss from runoff, seepage (SP), and lateral flow (LF), and increases in tile flow, total nitrate loss, and crop yields. On the basis of MCDA, the AP management scheme resulted in higher CP and total nitrate loss, whereas opposite outcomes were generated by the ES management scheme. Under the AT management scheme, higher ranked scenarios resulted in higher CP and lower total amounts of nitrate entering streams. Our analysis indicates that the AT scheme can simultaneously enhance crop production and ES through advances in tile drainage water treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Crop profits; Decision-making; Nitrate loss; Tile drainage impacts","Analytic hierarchy process; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental management; Hierarchical systems; Nitrates; Productivity; Profitability; Sustainable development; Water quality; Crop production; Crop profit; Decisions makings; Environmental sustainability; Management scheme; Nitrate loss; Tile drainage; Tile drainage impact; Tile drains; Tile spacing; Decision making"

However, a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art on the use of machine learning in Precision Nutrition is lacking. Therefore, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide an overview of where and how machine learning has been used in Precision Nutrition from various aspects, what such machine learning models use as input features, what the availability status of the data used in the literature is, and how the models are evaluated. Nine research questions were defined in this study. We retrieved 4930 papers from electronic databases and 60 primary studies were selected to respond to the research questions. All of the selected primary studies were also briefly discussed in this article. Our results show that fifteen problems spread across seven domains of nutrition and health are present. Four machine learning tasks are seen in the form of regression, classification, recommendation and clustering, with most of these utilizing a supervised approach. In total, 30 algorithms were used, with 19 appearing more than once. Models were through the use of four groups of approaches and 23 evaluation metrics. Personalized approaches are promising to reduce the burden of these current problems in nutrition research, and the current review shows Machine Learning can be incorporated into Precision Nutrition research with high performance.

Predicting ozone concentrations at specific locations is thus important to initiate protection measures, i.e. emission reductions or warnings to the population. Ozone levels at specific locations result from emission and sink processes, mixing and chemical transformation along an air parcel's trajectory. Current ozone forecasting systems generally rely on computationally expensive chemistry transport models (CTMs). However, recently several studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning for this task. While a few of these studies were trained on gridded model data, most efforts focus on forecasting time series from individual measurement locations. In this study, we present a hybrid approach which is based on time-series forecasting (up to 4 d) but uses spatially aggregated meteorological and chemical data from upstream wind sectors to represent some aspects of the chemical history of air parcels arriving at the measurement location. To demonstrate the value of this additional information, we extracted pseudo-observation data for Germany from a CTM to avoid extra complications with irregularly spaced and missing data. However, our method can be extended so that it can be applied to observational time series. Using one upstream sector alone improves the forecasts by 10 % during all 4 d, while the use of three sectors improves the mean squared error (MSE) skill score by 14 % during the first 2 d of the prediction but depends on the upstream wind direction. Our method shows its best performance in the northern half of Germany for the first 2 prediction days. Based on the data's seasonality and simulation period, we shed some light on our models' open challenges with (i) spatial structures in terms of decreasing skill scores from the northern German plain to the mountainous south and (ii) concept drifts related to an unusually cold winter season. Here we expect that the inclusion of explainable artificial intelligence methods could reveal additional insights in future versions of our model. © 2022 Felix Kleinert et al.",,"algorithm; experimental study; ozone; troposphere; wind direction"

Therefore, comparing the different machine learning algorithms is essential to provide insights into the performance of the different algorithms in predicting soil information for Indian landscapes. In this study, we compared a suite of six machine learning algorithms to predict quantitative (Cubist, decision tree, k-NN, multiple linear regression, random forest, support vector regression) and qualitative (C5.0, k-NN, multinomial logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forest, support vector machine) soil information separately at a regional level. The soil information, including the quantitative (pH, OC, and CEC) and qualitative (order, suborder, and great group) attributes, were extracted from the legacy soil maps using stratified random sampling procedures. A total of 4479 soil observations sampled were non-spatially partitioned and intersected with 39 environmental covariate parameters. The predicted maps depicted the complex soil–environmental relationships for the study area at a 30 m spatial resolution. The comparison was facilitated based on the evaluation metrics derived from the test datasets and visual interpretations of the predicted maps. Permutation feature importance analysis was utilised as the model-agnostic interpretation tool to determine the contribution of the covariate parameters to the model’s calibration. The R2 values for the pH, OC, and CEC ranged from 0.19 to 0.38; 0.04 to 0.13; and 0.14 to 0.40, whereas the RMSE values ranged from 0.75 to 0.86; 0.25 to 0.26; and 8.84 to 10.49, respectively. Irrespective of the algorithms, the overall accuracy percentages for the soil order, suborder, and great group class ranged from 31 to 67; 26 to 65; and 27 to 65, respectively. The tree-based ensemble random forest and rule-based tree models’ (Cubist and C5.0) algorithms efficiently predicted the soil properties spatially. However, the efficiency of the other models can be substantially increased by advocating additional parameterisation measures. The range and scale of the quantitative soil attributes, in addition to the sampling frequency and design, greatly influenced the model’s output. The comprehensive comparison of the algorithms can be utilised to support model selection and mapping at a varied scale. The derived digital soil maps will help farmers and policy makers to adopt precision information for making decisions at the farm level leading to productivity enhancements through the optimal use of nutrients and the sustainability of the agricultural ecosystem, ensuring food security. © 2022 by the authors.","digital soil mapping; machine learning; model comparison; SCORPAN; soil spatial predictions",

Also, the authors perform the feature visualization using the Grad-CAM. Now, the proposed model is integrated with a web application to provide a user-friendly interface.

The stipulation of expert advice for disease identification is also a challenge for the farmers. The traditional techniques adopted for plant disease detection require more human intervention, are unhandy for farmers, and have a high cost of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Therefore, there is a requirement for automating plant disease detection and classification. Deep learning and IoT-based solutions are proposed in the literature for plant disease detection and classification. However, there is a huge scope to develop low-cost systems by integrating these techniques for data collection, feature visualization, and disease detection. This research aims to develop the ‘Automatic and Intelligent Data Collector and Classifier’ framework by integrating IoT and deep learning. The framework automatically collects the imagery and parametric data from the pearl millet farmland at ICAR, Mysore, India. It automatically sends the collected data to the cloud server and the Raspberry Pi. The ‘Custom-Net’ model designed as a part of this research is deployed on the cloud server. It collaborates with the Raspberry Pi to precisely predict the blast and rust diseases in pearl millet. Moreover, the Grad-CAM is employed to visualize the features extracted by the ‘Custom-Net’. Furthermore, the impact of transfer learning on the ‘Custom-Net’ and state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19 is shown in this manuscript. Based on the experimental results, and features visualization by Grad-CAM, it is observed that the ‘Custom-Net’ extracts the relevant features and the transfer learning improves the extraction of relevant features. Additionally, the ‘Custom-Net’ model reports a classification accuracy of 98.78% that is equivalent to state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19. Although the classification of ‘Custom-Net’ is comparable to state-of-the-art models, it is effective in reducing the training time by 86.67%. It makes the model more suitable for automating disease detection. This proves that the proposed model is effective in providing a low-cost and handy tool for farmers to improve crop yield and product quality. © 2021 by the authors.

In the field of digital health care, user churn prediction is important not only in terms of company revenue but also for improving the health of users. Churn prediction has been previously studied, but most studies applied time-invariant model structures and used structured data. However, additional unstructured data have become available; therefore, it has become essential to process daily time-series log data for churn predictions. Objective: We aimed to apply a recurrent neural network structure to accept time-series patterns using lifelog data and text message data to predict the churn of digital health care users. Methods: This study was based on the use data of a digital health care app that provides interactive messages with human coaches regarding food, exercise, and weight logs. Among the users in Korea who enrolled between January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2019, we defined churn users according to the following criteria: users who received a refund before the paid program ended and users who received a refund 7 days after the trial period. We used long short-term memory with a masking layer to receive sequence data with different lengths. We also performed topic modeling to vectorize text messages. To interpret the contributions of each variable to model predictions, we used integrated gradients, which is an attribution method. Results: A total of 1868 eligible users were included in this study. The final performance of churn prediction was an F1 score of 0.89; that score decreased by 0.12 when the data of the final week were excluded (F1 score 0.77). Additionally, when text data were included, the mean predicted performance increased by approximately 0.085 at every time point. Steps per day had the largest contribution (0.1085). Among the topic variables, poor habits (eg, drinking alcohol, overeating, and late-night eating) showed the largest contribution (0.0875). Conclusions: The model with a recurrent neural network architecture that used log data and message data demonstrated high performance for churn classification. Additionally, the analysis of the contribution of the variables is expected to help identify signs of user churn in advance and improve the adherence in digital health care. © Hongwook Kwon, Ho Heon Kim, Jaeil An, Jae-Ho Lee, Yu Rang Park.

Besides assessing the average impacts of different types of coupons, we also investigate the heterogeneity of causal effects across different subgroups of customers, e.g., between clients with relatively high vs. low prior purchases. Finally, we use optimal policy learning to determine (in a data-driven way) which customer groups should be targeted by the coupon campaign in order to maximize the marketing intervention's effectiveness in terms of sales. We find that only two out of the five coupon categories examined, namely coupons applicable to the product categories of drugstore items and other food, have a statistically significant positive effect on retailer sales. The assessment of group average treatment effects reveals substantial differences in the impact of coupon provision across customer groups, particularly across customer groups as defined by prior purchases at the store, with drugstore coupons being particularly effective among customers with high prior purchases and other food coupons among customers with low prior purchases. Our study provides a use case for the application of causal machine learning in business analytics to evaluate the causal impact of specific firm policies (like marketing campaigns) for decision support.

For non-autonomous systems in states with a high degree of certainty, rational approaches exist to solve, model or control stable interactions; e.g., game theory, scale-free network theory, multi-agent systems, drone swarms. As an example, guided by artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning, ML) or by human operators, swarms of drones have made spectacular gains in applications too numerous to list (e.g., crop management; mapping, surveillance and fire-fighting systems; weapon systems). But under states of uncertainty or where conflict exists, rational models fail, exactly where interdependence theory thrives. Large, coupled physical or information systems can also experience synergism or dysergism from interdependence. Synergistically, the best human teams are not only highly interdependent, but they also exploit interdependence to reduce uncertainty, the focus of this work-in-progress and roadmap. We have long argued that interdependence is fundamental to human autonomy in teams. But for A-HMTs, no mathematics exists to build from rational theory or social science for their design nor safe or effective operation, a severe weakness. Compared to the rational and traditional social theory, we hope to advance interdependence theory first by mapping similarities between quantum theory and our prior findings; e.g., to maintain interdependence, we previously established that boundaries reduce dysergic effects to allow teams to function (akin to blocking interference to prevent quantum decoherence). Second, we extend our prior findings with case studies to predict with interdependence theory that as uncertainty increases in non-factorable situations for humans, the duality in two-sided beliefs serves debaters who explore alternatives with tradeoffs in the search for the best path going forward. Third, applied to autonomous teams, we conclude that a machine in an A-HMT must be able to express itself to its human teammates in causal language however imperfectly. © 2020 by the author.

Generally, customer's preferences or needs vary from person to person, and people are often reluctant to accept recommended food without reasonable explanation, especially when their demands are not explicitly addressed. In this paper, we are devoted to providing recipe suggestions accompanied by rational interpretations generated from images or videos. First, we construct a recipe knowledge graph (RcpKG) through the use of multi-modality and hierarchical thought, which focuses on the underlying demands of users and the consideration of multiple fine-grained factors. On this basis, a novel multi-modal recipe recommendation method via the knowledge graph (RcpMKR) is proposed, which represents nodes in multiple aspects and performs multi-relational graph structure extraction of the RcpKG. It not only takes into account local associations within the graph but also global information, and incorporates user concerns at different levels. Then, we adopt BERT-based multi-modal models and generative adversarial networks to generate interpretations. Additionally, dynamic convolution and random synthetic attention are utilized in our work to discriminate among features. Experimental results show that the proposed method and BERT-based fusion models improve recipe recommendation performance and explanation generation. Specifically, the precision of the RcpMKR method through RcpKG, user concerns and graph convolutional network improves by 7.82%, and the viExpCBTBERT method via 2D&3D convolutional neural networks for developing text interpretations enhances the F1-score by 10% compared with the baseline. © 2021","BERT; Interpretation generation; Knowledge graph; Multi-modality; Recipe recommender","Neural networks; BERT; Customer need; Customer preferences; Interpretation generation; Knowledge graphs; Matchings; Multi-modal; Multi-modality; Non-communicable disease; Recipe recommende; Convolution"

Unfortunately, many digesters suffer from unexpected perturbations and low biogas production due to the specific characteristics of food waste. Modeling of AD is crucial to better understand the process and improve efficiency. In this study, five machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to build models to predict biogas production in an industrial-scale biogas plant treating FW. Three categories of routine monitoring indicators (feed amount, feedstock properties, and digester properties), individually or collectively, were used as the input variables. The results showed that the random forest (RF) model achieved the best performance with an average R2 of 0.74 when all the indicators were contained in the dataset. Feature importance analysis revealed that the significance descended in the order of feed amount (45.9%), digester properties (38.6%), and feedstock properties (15.4%). The performance of the predictive models degraded with lag time except for the RF model, which showed the potential to predict biogas production of the next day (R2 = 0.73). The study verified the feasibility of ML models in predicting biogas yield using routine monitoring data from industrial-scale biogas plants treating FW and suggested that the monitoring indicators and frequency be redesigned to build smarter ML predictive models and improve system efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas plant operation; Machine learning; Online monitoring; Random forest","Biogas; Decision trees; E-learning; Feedstocks; Forecasting; Industrial plants; Machine learning; Random forests; Biogas plant operation; Biogas plants; Biogas production; Food waste; Industrial scale; Input variables; Machine-learning; Online monitoring; Plant operations; Random forests; Anaerobic digestion"

In this context, ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to develop multitask models for jointly predicting the CH4 yield and content in biogas and understanding this complicated process. Based on the best ensemble model with the R2 values of 0.82 and 0.86 for the multitask prediction of CH4 yield and content, the top three critical factors for CH4 yield/contents were identified and their interactions with process acid generation and microbial community in the AD process were comprehensively interpreted to unveil their importance on CH4 generation. Moreover, the well-developed ensemble model was integrated with an optimization algorithm to inversely design the AD process for a real-world food waste, in which the CH4 yield was as high as 468.7 mL/gVS and the calculation results were experimentally validated with relative errors of 9-16%.

However, challenges are faced when multispectral data are directly used to estimate the GPA due to the lack of corresponding sensitive feature bands. Objective or research question: The purpose of this study is to establish an estimation model that can monitor the dynamics of grain protein accumulation after rice heading. It aims to solve the monitoring of dynamic indicators (such as GPA) in the process of grain quality formation. Methods: To achieve progress in GPA monitoring, physiological parameters that are closely connected to GPA must be considered as an intermediate bridge between RS and GPA. The indirect model of “spectral parameter - physiological parameter - protein accumulation dynamic” was used in this study to develop a RS method for monitoring the dynamics of GPA based on a machine learning method. The GPA three-parameter estimation model was established using three physiological parameters as intermediate parameters: leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), and nitrogen harvest index (NHI) with the leaf N status. Results: The results show that the indirect model outperforms the direct estimation model of protein accumulation based on the vegetation index in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the GPA three-parameter estimation model was tested using dataset from different multispectral cameras (Mini-MCA6 and AIRPHEN), revealing the good performance with R2 and RMSE of 0.71 and 14.86 g / m2 respectively. Conclusions: These results indicated that incorporating nitrogen status and nitrogen partitioning into the GPA RS estimation model could improve the estimation accuracy of grain protein accumulation dynamics in rice.

We aim to establish an efficient and explainable machine learning (ML) model that associates heavy metals' exposure with CHD identification. Our datasets for investigating the associations between heavy metals and CHD were sourced from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (US NHANES, 2003–2018). Five ML models were established to identify CHD by heavy metals' exposure. Further, 11 discrimination characteristics were used to test the strength of the models. The optimally performing model was selected for identification. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool was used for interpreting the features to visualize the selected model's decision-making capacity. In total, 12,554 participants were eligible for this study. The best performing random forest classifier (RF) based on 13 heavy metals to identify CHD was chosen (AUC: 0.827; 95%CI: 0.777–0.877; accuracy: 95.9%). SHAP values indicated that cesium (1.62), thallium (1.17), antimony (1.63), dimethylarsonic acid (0.91), barium (0.76), arsenous acid (0.79), total arsenic (0.01) in urine, and lead (3.58) and cadmium (4.66) in blood positively contributed to the model, while cobalt (−0.15), cadmium (−2.93), and uranium (−0.13) in urine negatively contributed to the model. The RF model was efficient, accurate, and robust in identifying an association between heavy metals' exposure and CHD among US NHANES 2003–2018 participants.

Antibiotics are the most effective drugs to prevent and treat bacterial infection of mastitis. However, yet the growing problem of drug resistance, especially multidrug resistance (MDR), poses a great threat to disease control. To understand the MDR rules in bacteria of cow mastitis from national level, the main bacteria from cows with mastitis in large-scale farms were isolated and identified in China, and then drug sensitivity tests were conducted to establish a drug resistance data set. Aiming at the problem of numerous and disordered drug resistance data and lack of extensive correlations, a weighted Apriori association rule mining algorithm in conjunction with the bacterial drug resistance prevalence is proposed. We analyzed the associations between different antibiotics of key bacteria, extracted and visualized the key trends of high resistance prevalence and frequent occurrence, and discovered MDR patterns. Finally, a similarity comparison method based on Euclidean measurement was proposed to compare the relative MDR rules of different bacteria from the overall level with support, confidence, and promotion as characteristic parameters. The drug resistance data set showed that staphylococcus were the main bacteria isolated from dairy cow mastitis in China. Then based on the association rule algorithm, the important rules between different antibiotics resistance in this dataset were identified. In addition, the MDR patterns of different bacteria were visualized and analyzed by using the chord diagram. The results showed the bacteria are highly resistant to penicillin, gentamicin, and ampicillin, and most other antibiotics were linked with these three antibiotics. Finally, the high correlations and main rules in different bacteria were confirmed by a similarity comparison method. The assessment model and conclusions of this study are potentially valuable for assessing the evolution of MDR patterns, providing a scientific basis for relevant authorities to guide the rational use of antibiotics in the farming industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cow mastitis; Drug resistance; Multidrug resistance; Similarity analysis; Weighted association rule mining","Antibiotics; Association rules; Data mining; Disease control; Diseases; Losses; Statistical tests; Analysis method; Comparison methods; Cow mastiti; Data set; Drug-resistance; Multidrug resistance; Resistance analysis; Similarity analysis; Weighted association rule mining; Weighted association rules; Bacteria; algorithm; antibiotics; dairy farming; data set; disease; drug; drug resistance; pathogen; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Staphylococcus"

Yet, due to the complexity of these diseases' spots in terms of color and texture, their manual identification requires much time and energy. Developing a more efficient identification method could be imperative for improving the yield and quality of strawberry crops. To that end, here we proposed a detection framework for strawberry leaf diseases based on a dual-channel residual network with a multi-directional attention mechanism (MDAM-DRNet). (1) In order to fully extract the color features from images of diseased strawberry leaves, this paper constructed a color feature path at the front end of the network. The color feature information in the image was then extracted mainly through a color correlogram. (2) Likewise, to fully extract the texture features from images, a texture feature path at the front end of the network was built; it mainly extracts texture feature information by using an area compensation rotation invariant local binary pattern (ACRI-LBP). (3) To enhance the model's ability to extract detailed features, for the main frame, this paper proposed a multidirectional attention mechanism (MDAM). This MDAM can allocate weights in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, thereby reducing the loss of feature information. Finally, in order to solve the problems of gradient disappearance in the network, the ELU activation function was used in the main frame. Experiments were then carried out using a database we compiled. According to the results, the highest recognition accuracy by the network used in this paper for six types of strawberry leaf diseases and normal leaves is 95.79%, with an F1 score of 95.77%. This proves the introduced method is effective at detecting strawberry leaf diseases.

Furthermore, crop disease images create more difficulties for classification owing to the morphological and physiological changes of organs, tissues, and cells. Here, we propose a CNN model named CAMFFNet (coordinate attention-based multiple feature fusion network) for tobacco disease identification under field conditions. The CAMFFNet model has three multiple feature fusion (MFF) modules. Each module is composed of two residual blocks. The MFF module is concatenated by max-pooling downsampling layers at different locations in the residual blocks to realize a fusion between features of multiple depths, thereby reducing the loss of tobacco disease information. Furthermore, to enhance the ability to extract effective feature information of tobacco diseases and to alleviate the impact of the field environment, coordinate attention (CA) modules are included between each multiple feature fusion module. The obtained results show that the CAMFFNet model achieved an accuracy of 89.71 % on the tobacco disease test set. The accuracy was 3.36 %, 4.7 %, 4.7 %, 2.91 %, 8.05 %, 4.92 %, 10.07 %, and 2.91 % higher than those of the classic CNN models VGG16, GoogLeNet, DenseNet121, ResNet34, MobbileNetV2, MobbileNetV3 Large, ShuffleNetV2 1.0×, and EfficientNetV2 Small, respectively.

In this study, headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were adopted to rapidly and comprehensively evaluate the flavor compounds of dried CRCP, and to identify their dynamic changes at different fruit picking stages. Results revealed a total of 71 volatile compound in the samples at six different fruit picking stages. The C6–C9 alcohols and aldehydes with aromatic green grass profiles had higher concentrations in the early fruit picking stages (from July to October), while most terpenes, ketones, and esters with typical aromas of mature flowers and fruits were highly accumulated in the late fruit picking stages (from November to December).

Methods: We screened the dietary nutrients, blood biomarkers, and clinical information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015–16 database to assess a self-reported history of all strokes (136 strokes, n = 4381). We computed feature importance, built machine learning (ML) models, developed a nomogram, and validated the nomogram on NHANES 2007–08, 2017–18, and the baseline UK Biobank. We calculated the odds ratios with/without adjusting sampling weights (OR/ORw). Results: The clinical features have the best predictive power compared to dietary nutrients and blood biomarkers, with 22.8% increased average area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) in ML models. We further modeled with ten most important clinical features without compromising the predictive performance. The key features positively associated with stroke include age, cigarette smoking, tobacco smoking, Caucasian or African American race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma history; the negatively associated feature is the family income. The nomogram based on these key features achieved good performances (AUROC between 0.753 and 0.822) on the test set, the NHANES 2007–08, 2017–18, and the UK Biobank.

However, little is known about the exogenous factors capable of triggering the development of antibiotic tolerance, particularly in vivo. Here we uncovered that an previously approved food additive termed sodium dehydroacetate (DHA-S) supplementation remarkably impaired the activity of bactericidal antibiotics against various bacterial pathogens. Mechanistic studies indicated that DHA-S induced glyoxylate shunt and reduced bacterial cellular respiration by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH). Furthermore, DHA-S mitigated oxidative stress imposed by bactericidal antibiotics and enhanced the function of multidrug efflux pumps. These actions worked together to induce bacterial tolerance to antibiotic killing. Interestingly, the addition of five exogenous amino acids, particularly cysteine and proline, effectively reversed antibiotic tolerance elicited by DHA-S both in vitro and in mouse models of infection. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of the potential risks of DHA-S in the treatment of bacterial infections, and shed new insights into the relationships between antibiotic tolerance and bacterial metabolism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Antibiotic killing; Antibiotic tolerance; Bacteria; DHA-S; Metabolism","Amino acids; Metabolism; Sodium compounds; Antibiotic killing; Antibiotic tolerances; Bacterial metabolism; Bacterial pathogens; DHA-S; Exogenous factors; Global public health; Glyoxylate; In-vivo; Mechanistic studies; Antibiotics; acid; antibiotic agent; ciprofloxacin; clindamycin; colistin; dehydroacetic acid; florfenicol; kanamycin; meropenem; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; proline; tetracycline; tylosin; antiinfective agent; dehydroacetic acid; pyrone derivative; acetate; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; induced response; metabolism; oxidative stress; respiration; animal experiment; antimicrobial activity; Article; bacterial metabolism; bacterial strain; chemical structure; controlled study; drug tolerance; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; Gram negative bacterium; in vitro study; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular weight; mouse; nonhuman; outer membrane; practice guideline; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; animal; bacterium; microbial sensitivity test; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Mice; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pyrones"

Classifying the severity of crop diseases is the requirement for formulating disease prevention and control strategies. However, the differences between different severity of the same crop disease are very tiny. It increases the difficulty of correct crop disease recognition. For example, at the early stage of the disease, the lesions on the leaves are not obvious. And it is very difficult to extract the features of the lesions. However, these very small color and texture differences of the lesions are the key patterns to distinguish different kinds of diseases of the same species. In order to achieve better performance in the fine-grained classification of the crop diseases, a modified light-weight convolution neural network was proposed. Multi-scale convolution kernel and coordinate attention mechanism are introduced in SqueezeNext to extract the features of the lesions accurately. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the AI challenger 2018 plant disease recognition dataset, and the recognition accuracy can reach 91.94%, which is 3.02% point higher than the original SqueezeNext model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were carried out using ReseNet50, Xception and mobilenetv2. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method was slightly better than Xception, while the model size is only 2.83 MB, which is only 3.45% of Xception. The proposed method balances the performance and efficiency very well. Thus, it is suitable for deployment on mobile terminals and other embedded resource-constrained devices, which help to promote the popularization of smart agriculture application. © 2013 IEEE.","attention mechanism; Crop disease recognition; light-weight CNN; SqueezeNext","Bandpass filters; Convolution; Crops; Disease control; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Textures; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural network; Crop disease; Crop disease recognition; Features extraction; Information filter; Light weight; Light-weight CNN; Neural-networks; Plant; Squeezenext; Image recognition"

Breast cancer accounts for ∼20% of all new cancer cases worldwide, making it a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Mammography is an effective screening tool for the early detection and management of breast cancer. However, the identification and interpretation of breast lesions is challenging even for expert radiologists. For that reason, several Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are being developed to assist radiologists to accurately detect and/or classify breast cancer. This review examines the recent literature on the automatic detection and/or classification of breast cancer in mammograms, using both conventional feature-based machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The review begins with a comparison of algorithms developed specifically for the detection and/or classification of two types of breast abnormalities, micro-calcifications and masses, followed by the use of sequential mammograms for improving the performance of the algorithms. The available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CAD systems related to triage and diagnosis of breast cancer in mammograms are subsequently presented. Finally, a description of the open access mammography datasets is provided and the potential opportunities for future work in this field are highlighted. The comprehensive review provided here can serve both as a thorough introduction to the field but also provide indicative directions to guide future applications. © 2023 The Author(s)","Breast cancer; Computer-aided detection; Machine learning; Mammography; Review article","Biomineralization; Calcification (biochemistry); Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; Diseases; Learning algorithms; X ray screens; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer classifications; Breast cancer detection; Computer aided detection; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Computer-aided; Identification and Interpretation; Machine-learning; Review article; Screening tool; Mammography; algorithm; breast tumor; computer; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; female; human; mammography; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Computers; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography"

Establishing of fast and accurate in situ nitrate monitoring approaches that could be used in the plant growth process and vegetable markets is essential. Incorporating the unique feature of N − O asymmetric stretch absorption in the mid-infrared region (1500–1200 cm−1), portable attenuated total reflectance–Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic instrument, along with the Euclidean distance-modified extreme learning machine (ED-ELM) model, was firstly employed to evaluate the nitrate contents in leafy vegetables. A total of 1224 samples of four popular vegetables (Chinese cabbage, water spinach, celery, and lettuce) were analyzed. The results indicated that the coefficient of variation of nitrate contents between different vegetable samples was large (20–30%) and the value of mean values has highly exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)–specified maximum tolerance limits. Chinese cabbage: 7550 ± 1664 mg kg−1; water spinach: 4219 ± 1029 mg kg−1; celery: 4164 ± 1214 mg kg−1; lettuce: 4322 ± 1024 mg kg−1). Moreover, The ED-ELM model showed a better performance with the RMSEP of 799.7 mg kg−1 (calibration range from 805 to 14,104 mg kg−1 and validation range from 2132 to 11,793 mg kg−1), R2 of 0.93, RPD of 2.22, the optimized calibration dataset number of 100, and the number of hidden neurons of 30. The results confirmed that ATR-FTIR, along with the suitable model algorithms, could be used as a potential rapid and accurate method to monitor the nitrate contents in the fields of agriculture and food safety.

Wheat quality is primarily determined by the grain protein content (GPC) and composition, and both of these are affected by nitrogen (N) levels in the plant as it develops during the growing season. Hyperspectral remote sensing is gradually becoming recognized as an economical alternative to traditional destructive field sampling methods and laboratory testing as a means of determining the N status within wheat. Currently, hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) and linear nonparametric regression are the primary tools for monitoring the N status of wheat. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied to model the nonlinear relationship between spectral data and wheat N status. This study is a comprehensive review of available N-related hyperspectral VIs and aims to inform the selection of VIs under field conditions. The combination of feature mining and machine learning algorithms is discussed as an application of hyperspectral imaging systems. We discuss the major challenges and future directions for evaluating and assessing wheat N status. Finally, we suggest that the underlying mechanism of protein formation in wheat grains as determined by using hyperspectral imaging systems needs to be further investigated. This overview provides theoretical and technical support to promote applications of hyperspectral imaging systems in wheat N status assessments; in addition, it can be applied to help monitor and evaluate food and nutrition security.

One of the important aspects in agriculture is the analysis of soil nutrients and balancing these inputs are essential for proper crop growth. The crop productivity and the soil fertility can be improved with effective nutrient management and precise application of fertilizers. This can be done by identifying the deficient nutrients with the help of an IoT system. As traditional approach is time consuming, an IoT-enabled system is developed using the colorimetry principle which analyzes the amount of nutrients present in the soil and a fuzzy expert system is designed to recommend the quantity of fertilizers to be added in the soil. A set of 27 IF-THEN rules are framed using the Mamdani inference system by relating the input and output membership functions based on the linguistic variable for fertilizer recommendation. The experiments are conducted using MATLAB for different ranges of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K). The NPK data retrieved by the system is sent to the ThingSpeak cloud and displayed on a mobile application that assists the farmers to know the nutrient information of their field.

In recent years, advances in omics techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, paved the way for accelerating plant/crop breeding to cope with the changing climate and enhance food production. Optimized omics and phenotypic plasticity platform integration, exploited by evolving machine learning algorithms will aid in the development of biological interpretations for complex crop traits. The precise and progressive assembly of desire alleles using precise genome editing approaches and enhanced breeding strategies would enable future crops to excel in combating the changing climates.

This article reports new research that followed a design science approach to develop and investigate a co-creative tool called Sport Sparks in one profession – the coaching of professional football players. In response to a coach entering a text description of a coaching challenge (e.g., struggling to maintain the fitness of an athlete) into the tool, the tool automatically generated potentially novel ideas (e.g., reducing game time and changing their nutrition) that the coach could select and/or adapt and evolve into a simple action plan (e.g., which links nutrition to increased game time). This Sport Sparks tool was designed to be an example of human-centred artificial intelligence that aspires to empower humans, to deliver high levels of human control as well as automation, and empower people rather than emulate their expertise. It was engineered with rule-based reasoning to automate the generation of potential new ideas that coaches could select and refine during interactions which provide high user control over this automation. The potential of such a co-creative tool, and value of the guidelines, were demonstrated during the tool's evaluation by coaching practitioners at a Premier League football club. The practitioners used the tool to generate new ideas to coaching challenges, and reported evidence of different forms of creative thinking, although some also reported the need for more support for creative collaborations and solution planning.

To aid in stream restoration and management, baseline estimates of conditions and improved explanation of factors driving their degradation are needed. We used random forests to model biological conditions using a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity for small, non-tidal streams (upstream area ≤200 km2) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) of the mid-Atlantic coast of North America. We utilized several global and local model interpretation tools to improve average and site-specific model inferences, respectively. The model was used to predict condition for 95,867 individual catchments for eight periods (2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019). Predicted conditions were classified as Poor, FairGood, or Uncertain to align with management needs and individual reach lengths and catchment areas were summed by condition class for the CBW for each period. Global permutation and local Shapley importance values indicated percent of forest, development, and agriculture in upstream catchments had strong impacts on predictions. Development and agriculture negatively influenced stream condition for model average (partial dependence [PD] and accumulated local effect [ALE] plots) and local (individual condition expectation and Shapley value plots) levels. Friedman's H-statistic indicated large overall interactions for these three land covers, and bivariate global plots (PD and ALE) supported interactions among agriculture and development. Total stream length and catchment area predicted in FairGood conditions decreased then increased over the 19-years (length/area: 66.6/65.4% in 2001, 66.3/65.2% in 2011, and 66.6/65.4% in 2019). Examination of individual catchment predictions between 2001 and 2019 showed those predicted to have the largest decreases in condition had large increases in development; whereas catchments predicted to exhibit the largest increases in condition showed moderate increases in forest cover. Use of global and local interpretative methods together with watershed-wide and individual catchment predictions support conservation practitioners that need to identify widespread and localized patterns, especially acknowledging that management actions typically take place at individual-reach scales. © 2022","Benthic macroinvertebrates; Individual conditional expectation plots; Interpretable machine learning; Partial dependence and accumulated local effect plots; Random forests; Shapley values","machine learning; agriculture; article; catchment area; climate model; expectation; forest; human; land use; machine learning; macroinvertebrate; nonhuman; North America; physician; prediction; random forest; seashore; stream (river); bay; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; machine learning; procedures; river; Atlantic Ocean; Bay; Chesapeake Bay; North America; Somalia; United States; United States; Agriculture; Bays; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Rivers"

We modeled possible effects of a suite of 2030, 2060, and 2090 land-use and climate scenarios on the condition of 70,772 small streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, United States. The Chesapeake Basin-wide Index of Biotic Integrity, a benthic macroinvertebrate multimetric index, was used to represent stream condition. Land-use scenarios included four Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2) representing a range of potential landscape futures. Future climate scenarios included quartiles of future climate changes from downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP5) and a watershed-wide uniform scenario (Lynch2016). We employed random forests analysis to model individual and combined effects of land-use and climate change on stream conditions. Individual scenarios suggest that by 2090, watershed-wide conditions may exhibit anywhere from large degradations (e.g., scenarios A1B, A2, and the CMIP5 25th percentile) to small degradations (e.g., scenarios B1, B2, and Lynch2016). Combined land-use and climate change scenarios highlighted their interaction and predicted, by 2090, watershed-wide degradation in 16.2% (A2 CMIP5 25th percentile) to 1.0% (B2 Lynch2016) of stream kilometers. A goal for the Chesapeake Bay watershed is to restore 10% of stream kilometers over a 2008 baseline; our results suggest meeting and sustaining this goal until 2090 may require improvement in 11.0%–26.2% of stream kilometers, dependent on land-use and climate scenario. These results highlight inherent variability among scenarios and the resultant uncertainty of predicted conditions, which reinforces the need to incorporate multiple scenarios of both land-use (e.g., development, agriculture, etc.) and climate change in future studies to encapsulate the range of potential future conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

Historically, most SDM research concentrated on well-known organisms, especially vertebrates. In recent years, these tools are becoming increasingly important for predicting the distribution of understudied invertebrate taxa. Here, we reviewed the literature published on main terrestrial arthropod predators (ants, ground beetles and spiders) to explore some of the challenges and opportunities of species distribution modelling in mega-diverse arthropod groups. Location: Global. Methods: Systematic mapping of the literature and bibliometric analysis. Results: Most SDM studies of animals to date have focused either on broad samples of vertebrates or on arthropod species that are charismatic (e.g. butterflies) or economically important (e.g. vectors of disease, crop pests and pollinators). We show that the use of SDMs to map the geography of terrestrial arthropod predators is a nascent phenomenon, with a near-exponential growth in the number of studies over the past ten years and still limited collaborative networks among researchers. There is a bias in studies towards charismatic species and geographical areas that hold lower levels of diversity but greater availability of data, such as Europe and North America. Conclusions: Arthropods pose particular modelling challenges that add to the ones already present for vertebrates, but they should also offer opportunities for future SDM research as data and new methods are made available.

For example, establishing farming actions on the crop requires analyzing variables such as temperature, ambient humidity, soil moisture, solar irradiance, and Rainfall. Although these signals might contain valuable information, it is vital to mix up the monitored signals and analyze them as a whole to provide more accurate information than analyzing the signals separately. Unfortunately, monitoring all these variables results in high costs. Hence it is necessary to establish an appropriate method that allows the infer variables behavior without the direct measurement of all of them. This paper introduces a multi-sensor data fusion technique, based on a sparse representation, to find the most straightforward and complete linear equation to predict and understand a particular variable behavior based on other monitored environmental variables measurements. Moreover, this approach aims to provide an interpretable model that allows understanding how these variables are combined to achieve such results. The fusion strategy explained in this manuscript follows a four-step process that includes 1. data cleaning, 2. redundant variable detection, 3. dictionary generation, and 4. sparse regression. The algorithm requires a target variable and two highly correlated signals. It is essential to point out that the developed method has no restrictions to specific variables. Consequently, it is possible to replicate this method for the semiautomatic prediction of multiple critical environmental variables. As a case study, this work used the SML2010 data set of the UCI machine learning repository to predicted the humidity's derivative trend function with an error rate lower than 17% and a mean absolute error lower than 6%. The experiment results show that even though sparse model predictions might not be the most accurate compared to those of linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) since it is not a black-box model, it guarantees greater interpretability of the problem. © 2021 China Agricultural University","Humidity; Inference of variables; Multi-sensor data fusion; Precision agriculture; Sparse representation","Agricultural robots; Forecasting; Precision agriculture; Sensor data fusion; Soil moisture; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Data fusion strategy; Environmental variables; Extreme learning machine; Mean absolute error; Multisensor data fusion; Redundant variables; Sparse representation; UCI machine learning repository; Learning systems; air temperature; crop; environmental factor; humidity; irradiance; precision agriculture; prediction; rainfall; soil moisture"

The ethical language associated with food supply and technology is contextualised and framed by the meaning given to it by stakeholders. Failure to differentiate between these nuanced meanings can create a barrier to technology adoption and reduce the benefit derived. Scope and approach: The aim of this review paper is to consider the embedded ethical language used by stakeholders who collaborate in the adoption of AI in food supply chains. Ethical perspectives frame this literature review and provide structure to consider how to shape a common discourse to build trust in, and frame more considered utilisation of, AI in food supply chains to the benefit of users, and wider society. Key findings and conclusions: Whilst the nature of data within the food system is much broader than the personal data covered by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ethical issues for computational and AI systems are similar and can be considered in terms of particular aspects: transparency, traceability, explainability, interpretability, accessibility, accountability and responsibility. The outputs of this research assist in giving a more rounded understanding of the language used, exploring the ethical interaction of aspects of AI used in food supply chains and also the management activities and actions that can be adopted to improve the applicability of AI technology, increase engagement and derive greater performance benefits.

This is particularly relevant for the frequent monitoring required to assess progress towards the UNs' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) is a region of international ecological importance, containing the Indian portion of the world's largest mangrove forest. The region is densely populated and home to over 4.4 million people, many living in chronic poverty with a strong dependence on nature-based rural livelihoods. Such livelihoods are vulnerable to frequent natural hazards including cyclone landfall and storm surges. In this study we examine associations between environmental variables derived from EO and geospatial data with a village level multidimensional poverty metric using random forest machine learning, to provide evidence in support of policy formulation in the field of poverty reduction. We find that environmental variables can predict up to 78% of the relative distribution of the poorest villages within the SBR. Exposure to cyclone hazard was the most important variable for prediction of poverty. The poorest villages were associated with relatively small areas of rural settlement (<∼30%), large areas of agricultural land (>∼50%) and moderate to high cyclone hazard. The poorest villages were also associated with less productive agricultural land than the wealthiest. Analysis suggests villages with access to more diverse livelihood options, and a smaller dependence on agriculture may be more resilient to cyclone hazard. This study contributes to the understanding of poverty-environment dynamics within Low-and middle-income countries and the associations found can inform policy linked to socio-environmental scenarios within the SBR and potentially support monitoring of work towards SDG1 (No Poverty) across the region. © 2022 The Authors","Population environment; Poverty; Random forest; Remote sensing; SDGs; Socio-ecological systems","agricultural land; census; environmental factor; livelihood; machine learning; mangrove; natural hazard; poverty; prediction; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; vulnerability; agricultural land; agriculture; article; biosphere; ecosystem; human; India; machine learning; middle income country; poverty; prediction; random forest; remote sensing; storm surge; sustainable development goal; developing country; environmental protection; income; India; questionnaire; rural population; socioeconomics; India; Sundarbans National Park; West Bengal; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Humans; Income; India; Poverty; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Therefore, monitoring water quality is essential for the management of element transport, biodiversity, and public goods in lakes. We investigated the ability of machine learning models to predict eight important water quality variables (alkalinity, pH, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, color, and pCO2) using monitoring data from 924 to 1054 lakes. The geospatial predictor variables comprise a wide range of potential drivers at the lake, buffer zone, and catchment level. We compared the performance of nine predictive models of varying complexity for each of the eight water quality variables. The best models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine in six and two cases, respectively) generally performed well on the test set (R2 = 0.28–0.60). Models were then used to predict water quality for all 180,377 mapped Danish lakes. Additionally, we trained models to predict each water quality variable by using the predictions we had generated for the remaining seven variables. This improved model performance (R2 = 0.45–0.78). Overall, the uncovered relationships were in line with the findings of previous studies, e.g., total nitrogen was positively related to catchment agriculture and chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, and alkalinity were influenced by soil type and landscape history. Remarkably, buffer zone geomorphology (curvature, ruggedness, and elevation) had a strong influence on nutrients, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth, e.g., curvature was positively related to nutrients and chlorophyll a and negatively to Secchi depth. Lake area was a strong predictor of multiple variables, especially its relationship with pH (positive), pCO2 (negative), and color (negative). Our analysis shows that the combination of machine learning methods and geospatial data can be used to predict lake water quality and improve national upscaling of predictions related to nutrient and carbon cycling. © 2022 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Geomorphology; Machine learning; Nutrients; Predictive modeling; Watershed","Alkalinity; Antennas; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Geomorphology; Lakes; Landforms; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Runoff; Support vector machines; Water quality; Buffer zones; Carbon cycling; Chlorophyll a; Geo-spatial; Machine-learning; Nutrients cycling; Predictive models; Secchi depth; Total nitrogen; Water quality variables; Decision trees; carbon dioxide; chlorophyll a; nitrogen; phosphorus; carbon; chlorophyll a; nitrogen; phosphorus; carbon dioxide; catchment; geomorphology; lowland environment; machine learning; nutrient dynamics; prediction; temperate environment; water quality; watershed; agriculture; alkalinity; Article; catchment area (hydrology); environmental monitoring; geomorphology; lake; machine learning; pH; prediction; random forest; support vector machine; water quality; watershed; ecosystem; procedures; soil; Carbon; Chlorophyll A; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil; Water Quality"

Recent progress in deep neural network (or deep learning) techniques would allow easy, but highly accurate diagnosis with single RGB images, and the latest applications enable visualization of “the reasons for each diagnosis” by backpropagation of neural networks. Here, we propose an application of deep learning for image diagnosis on the classification of internal fruit traits, in this case seedlessness, in persimmon fruit (Diospyros kaki). We examined the classification of seedlessness in persimmon fruit by using four convolutional neural networks (CNN) models with various layer structures. With only 599 pictures of ‘Fuyu’ persimmon fruit from the fruit apex side, the neural networks successfully made a binary classification of seedless and seeded fruits with up to 85% accuracy. Among the four CNN models, the VGG16 model with the simplest layer structure showed the highest classification accuracy of 89%. Prediction values for the binary classification of seeded fruits were significantly increased in proportion to seed numbers in all four CNN models. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Guided Grad-CAM, allowed visualization of the parts and patterns contributing to the diagnosis. The results indicated that finer positions surrounding the apex, which correspond to hypothetical bulges derived from seeds, are an index for seeded fruits. These results suggest the novel potential of deep learning for noninvasive diagnosis of fruit internal traits using simple RGB images and also provide novel insights into previously unrecognized features of seeded/seedless fruits. © 2021 The Japanese Society for Horticultural Science (JSHS), All rights reserved.","Convolution neural network; Fruit internal trait; Image diagnosis; Seed number; Visual explanations",

Among the different approaches, machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly adopted, since they allow exploiting all the information on crop progress and environmental conditions and their relations with crop yield, achieving reliable and accurate estimations. However, interpreting the relationships learned by the ML models, and hence getting insights about the problem, remains a complex and usually unexplored task. Without accountability, confidence and trust in the ML models can be compromised. Here, we develop interpretable ML approaches for crop yield estimation that allow us investigating the most informative agro-ecological drivers and influencial regions learned by the models. We conduct a set of experiments to learn the selection of agro-ecological drivers leading to best estimations of main crops grown in Europe: corn, barley and wheat. As input data, we consider a variety of multi-scale Earth observation products sensitive to canopy greenness (e.g. EVI and LAI), its water-uptake dynamics (e.g. VOD) and available water (soil moisture), as well as climatic variables from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (e.g. temperature and radiation). Our results show that the best performances (R2&gt;0.55 for corn and R2&gt;0.8 for both barley and wheat) are obtained when descriptors of soil, vegetation, and atmosphere status are used as input in the ML models. This combination of variables outperforms the results obtained using single variables as inputs or all variables altogether. We then further analyze the relations of input features with crop yield in the developed models by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We show how the information learned by the GPR model allows us to identify atypical or anomalous crop seasons across the study region, and investigate the underlying factors behind crop progress and failure in Europe. © 2021","Crop Yield Estimation; ERA5-Land; Gaussian Process; Interpretability; Machine Learning; MODIS; Optical and Passive Microwave sensors","crop yield; environmental conditions; Gaussian method; machine learning; MODIS; remote sensing; sensor; Europe"

We demonstrate that the knowledge-based models can improve machine learning by generating expert-engineered features.

Every year, this sector faces a substantial loss in production and profit due to a large number of diseases in crops and plants. If those diseases are not detected early and taken measures for prevention, it can bring about a devastating result that can financially burden agriculture personnel. Traditional methods of detecting diseases in plants and crops offer high accuracy. However, the procedure is time-consuming, which might be insidious in most cases. Crop diseases need to be detected and cured as soon as possible as most diseases are highly contagious among crops and plants. In this paper, we have used the transfer learning approach with three pre-trained models: EfficientNetV2L, MobileNetV2, and ResNet152V2, to detect various plant diseases. We have proposed a framework to detect 38 types of leaf diseases in 14 different plants, compared the three pre-trained models based on various quantitative performance evaluation parameters, and demonstrated that EfficientNetV2L performed best with 99.63% accuracy.

Of particular interest in these discussions is the extent to which the output or predictions of algorithms and tools are understandable by medical practitioners. This work proposes a simple nomenclature that is intelligible to both clinicians and developers for quickly describing the interpretability of model results.

Tools based on artificial neural networks have shown high potential for predicting the behavior and properties of industrial components. Aluminum alloys are among the most broadly used materials in challenging industries such as aerospace, automotive, or food packaging. In this study, a computer-aided tool is developed to predict two of the most useful mechanical properties of metallic materials to characterize the plastic behavior, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. These prognostics are based on the alloy chemical composition, tempers, and Brinell hardness. In this study, a material database is employed to train an artificial neural network that is able to make predictions with a confidence greater than 95%. It is also shown that this methodology achieves a performance similar to that of empirical equations developed expressly for a specific material, but it provides greater generality since it can approximate the properties of any aluminum alloy. The methodology is based on the usage of artificial neural networks supported by a big data collection about the properties of thousands of commercial materials. Thus, the input data go above 2000 entries. When the relevant information has been collected and organized, an artificial neural network is defined, and after the training, the artificial intelligence is able to make predictions about the material properties with an average confidence greater than 95%. © 2020 by the authors.

This transition will require changing crop improvement objectives to consider the entire system, and thus provide solutions to improve complex systems for higher productivity, resource use efficiency, and environmental quality. The methods and approaches that underpinned the doubling of yields during the last century may no longer be fully adequate to target crop improvement for circular agricultural systems. Here we propose a multidimensional framework for prediction with outcomes useful to assess both crop performance traits and environmental sustainability of the designed agricultural systems. The study focuses on maize harvestable grain yield and total carbon production, water use, and use efficiency for yield and carbon. The framework builds on the crop growth model whole genome prediction system, which is enabled by advanced phenomics and the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We demonstrate the approach and prediction accuracy advantages over a standard statistical genomic prediction approach used to breed maize hybrids for yield, flowering time, and kernel set using a dataset comprised of 7004 hybrids, 103 breeding populations, and 62 environments resulting from six years of experimentation in maize drought breeding in the U.S. We propose this framework to motivate a dialogue for how to enable circularity in agriculture through prediction-based systems design. © 2022 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Circular bioeconomy; Circular economy; Crop improvement; Crop models; Drought; Gene editing; Genomic prediction; Maize; Plant breeding","Carbon; Crops; Drought; Efficiency; Forecasting; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Agricultural system; Circular bioeconomy; Circular economy; Crop improvement; Crop modeling; Gene editing; Genomic predictions; Maize; Plant breeding; Use efficiency; Genes; agricultural modeling; alternative agriculture; crop improvement; drought; maize; plant breeding; spatiotemporal analysis; United States"

By systematically evaluating thirteen methods (some for knowledge graphs) on eight different semantic resources, including Gene Ontology, Food Ontology, Marine Ontology, and similar ontologies, we demonstrate that a structure-only link analysis can offer a scalable and computationally efficient ontology completion approach for a subset of analyzed data sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the most extensive systematic study of the applicability of different types of link analysis methods across semantic resources from different domains.

Currently, there are 190 FDA-approved radiology AI-based software devices, 42 of which pertain specifically to thoracic radiology. The majority of these algorithms are approved for the detection and/or analysis of pulmonary nodules, for monitoring placement of endotracheal tubes and indwelling catheters, for detection of emergent findings, and for assessment of pulmonary parenchyma; however, as technology evolves, there are many other potential applications that can be explored. For example, evaluation of non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis interstitial lung diseases, synthesis of imaging, clinical and/or laboratory data to yield comprehensive diagnoses, and survival or prognosis prediction of certain pathologies.

The main economic advantage of this approach is that since these drugs have already passed all the safety tests, it vastly reduces the overall cost of clinical trials. Recently, several machine learning approaches have been developed for predicting promising antibiotics by training on bioactivity data collected on a set of small molecules. However, these methods report hundreds/thousands of bioactive molecules, and it remains unclear which of these molecules possess a novel mechanism of action. While the cost of high-throughput bioactivity testing has dropped dramatically in recent years, determining the mechanism of action of small molecules remains a costly and time-consuming step, and therefore computational methods for prioritizing molecules with novel mechanisms of action are needed. The existing approaches for predicting bioactivity of small molecules are based on uninterpretable machine learning, and therefore are not capable of determining known mechanism of action of small molecules and prioritizing novel mechanisms. We introduce InterPred, an interpretable technique for predicting bioactivity of small molecules and their mechanism of action. InterPred has the same accuracy as the state of the art in bioactivity prediction, and it enables assigning chemical moieties that are responsible for bioactivity. After analyzing bioactivity data of several thousand molecules against bacterial and fungal pathogens available from Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery and a US Food and Drug Association-approved drug library, InterPred identified five known links between moieties and mechanism of action. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"antiinfective agent; bacterium; chemistry; drug development; machine learning; procedures; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacteria; Drug Discovery; Machine Learning"

Such dietary choices, however, can severely affect people's health. One countermeasure could be to improve one's emotion regulation ability. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural activity underlying the downregulation of incidental emotions and its effect on subsequent food choices. We investigated whether emotion regulation leads to healthier food choices and how emotion regulation interacts with the brain's valuation and decision-making circuitry. We found that 1) the downregulation of incidental negative emotions was associated with a subsequent selective increase in decisions for tasty but also for healthy foods, 2) food preferences were predicted by palatability but also by the current emotional state, and 3) emotion regulation modulated decision-related activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. These results indicate that emotional states are indeed important for food choice and that the process of emotion regulation might boost the subsequent processing of health attributes, possibly via neural reward circuits. In consequence, our findings suggest that increasing emotion regulation ability could effectively modulate food choices by stimulating an incidental upvaluation of health attributes. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Our objective was to develop machine learning prediction models for exploring how nutrients are related to CVD risk and to evaluate their predictive performance. We established a population-based cohort from the Canadian Community Health Survey and measured CVD incidence and mortality from 2004 to 2018 using administrative databases of national hospital discharges and deaths. Predictors included 61 nutrition variables and fourteen socioeconomic, demographic, psychological, and behavioural variables. Conditional inference forest models were interpreted and evaluated by permutation feature importance, accumulated local effects, and predictive discrimination and calibration. A total of 12 130 individuals were included in the study. Use of supplements, caffeine, and alcohol were the most important nutrition variables for prediction of CVD. Supplement use was associated with decreased risk, caffeine was associated with increasing risk, and alcohol had a u-shaped association with risk. The model had an out-of-sample c-statistic of 0.821 (95% confidence interval = 0.801–0.842). Exploratory findings included both known and novel associations and predictive performance was competitive, suggesting that further application of machine learning to nutritional epidemiology may help elucidate risks and improve predictive models. Novelty: • Machine learning prediction models were developed for CVD using dietary data. • Models were interpreted with interpretable machine learning techniques, revealing diverse associations between diet and CVD. • Models achieved comparable or superior predictive performance to existing CVD risk prediction models. © 2022 The Author(s).","24-hour dietary recall; Artificial intelligence; Canadian; Cardiovascular disease; Heart disease; Machine learning; Nutritional epidemiology; Population health; Stroke","caffeine; Canada; cardiovascular disease; human; machine learning; procedures; risk assessment; Caffeine; Canada; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Machine Learning; Nutrients; Risk Assessment"

The objective of this perspective article is to highlight how developments in big data and machine learning can help address these challenges. New methods of collecting 24-h dietary recalls and recording diet could enable larger samples andmore repeatedmeasures to increase statistical power and measurement precision. In addition, use of machine learning to automatically classify pictures of food could become a useful complimentary method to help improve precision and validity of dietary measurements. Diet is complex due to thousands of different foods that are consumed in varying proportions, fluctuating quantities over time, and differing combinations. Current dietary pattern methods may not integrate sufficient dietary variation, and most traditional modeling approaches have limited incorporation of interactions and nonlinearity. Machine learning could help better model diet as a complex exposure with nonadditive and nonlinear associations. Last, novel big data sources could help avoid unmeasured confounding by offering more covariates, including both omics and features derived from unstructured data with machine learning methods. These opportunities notwithstanding, application of big data and machine learning must be approached cautiously to ensure quality of dietary measurements, avoid overfitting, and confirm accurate interpretations. Greater use of machine learning and big data would also require substantial investments in training, collaborations, and computing infrastructure. Overall, we propose that judicious application of big data and machine learning in nutrition science could offer new means of dietary measurement, more tools to model the complexity of diet and its relations with diseases, and additional potential ways of addressing confounding. © 2021 The Author(s).

These data are related to climate, amount of water used for irrigation, fertilization products by dose, phytosanitary treatment dose, parcel size, and root-stock type on each parcel. Additionally, two very popular indices, the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index were extracted from Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellite images to improve prediction scores. We managed to build a total dataset composed of 250 rows, representing the 50 parcels over a period of 5 years labeled with the yield of each parcel.

Whilst the activity of these compounds is clear, both in vitro and in formulation, little information exists on the potential impact that common preservative systems, in full formulation, have on the skin's resident microbiome. Dysbiosis of the skin's microbiome has been associated with a number of cosmetic conditions but there currently are no in vivo studies investigating the potential for preservative ingredients, when included in personal care formulations under normal use conditions, to impact the cutaneous microbiome. Here we present an analysis of four in vivo studies that examine the impact of different preservation systems in full formulation, in different products formats, with varying durations of application.

To encourage users to select healthier recommendations by making more informed food decisions, we introduce a methodology to generate and present a natural language justification that emphasizes the nutritional content, or health risks and benefits of recommended recipes. We designed a framework that takes a user and two food recommendations as input and produces an automatically generated natural language justification as output, which is based on the user's characteristics and the recipes' features. In doing so, we implemented and evaluated eight different justification strategies through two different justification styles (e.g., comparing each recipe's food features) in an online user study (N = 503). We compared user food choices for two personalized recommendation approaches, popularity-based vs our health-aware algorithm, and evaluated the impact of presenting natural language justifications. We showed that comparative justifications styles are effective in supporting choices for our healthy-aware recommendations, confirming the impact of our methodology on food choices. © 2021 ACM.","Decision making; Explanation; Food recommender systems; Natural language processing","Nutrition; Recommender systems; Automatically generated; Natural languages; Online users; Personalized recommendation; Health risks"

Climate variability and difficult economic conditions are pressuring farmers to produce higher (maize) yields with fewer inputs, per hectare. The remote sensing of crop specific structural parameters are essential in identifying the particular growth stages of the maize crop which require specific tasks from the farmer (e.g. weed control, top dressing, pesticide application for disease and borer control and critical moisture phase). This study sought to assess the performance of multiple linear regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the estimation of four maize crop structural parameters in a study area in the Vereeniging region of the Maize Triangle of South Africa. These parameters were leaf area index (LAI), stem height (HT), stem diameter (DIA) and stem density (SD). An additional aim was to investigate whether the combination of selected spectral vegetation indices (red-edge, chlorophyll, senescence and greenness) with Sentinel-2 reflectance bands as modelling predictors yielded improved results over the individual spectral bands alone. Combining reflectance bands and vegetation indices as modelling predictors yielded the highest validation accuracy, over other scenarios, for only one out of the four crop structural parameters (DAI). The reflectance bands only scenario yielded the highest validation accuracies for two crop structural parameters (HT and SD). The use of spectral vegetation indices alone as modelling predictors yielded the highest modelling accuracies for the LAI crop parameter than the other scenarios. These trends indicate that the combination of Sentinel-2 reflectance bands and derived vegetation indices do not always yield improved modelling results for the four crop structural parameters under investigation. As a result, reflectance bands (mostly) or indices alone could suffice for nearly all of the parameters. With respect to the modelling algorithms, LR yielded the highest accuracies for DIA and SD (Standard Error of Prediction or SEP values of 22.40%±4.65 and 34.15%±2.72 respectively). GPR yielded the highest accuracies for LAI and HT (SEP values of 28.69%±3.84 and 23.19%±2.27 respectively) while RF did not yield the highest validation accuracy for any of the crop structural parameters. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Decision trees; Disease control; Food supply; Linear regression; Machine learning; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Weed control; Gaussian process regression; High-accuracy; Leaf Area Index; Machine learning models; Random forests; South Africa; Spectral vegetation indices; Stem density; Structural parameter; Vegetation index; Crops; growth rate; leaf area index; machine learning; maize; modeling; remote sensing; Sentinel; stem; vegetation index; South Africa"

Objective: Our study had two aims. First, we aimed to identify essential depression-associated factors using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm from big survey data (the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2012-2016). Second, we aimed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of multifactorial features in depression using network analysis. Methods: An XGBoost model was trained and tested to classify “current depression” and “no lifetime depression” for a data set of 120 variables for 12,596 cases. The optimal XGBoost hyperparameters were set by an automated machine learning tool (TPOT), and a high-performance sparse model was obtained by feature selection using the feature importance value of XGBoost. We performed statistical tests on the model and nonmodel factors using survey-weighted multiple logistic regression and drew a correlation network among factors. We also adopted statistical tests for the confounder or interaction effect of selected risk factors when it was suspected on the network. Results: The XGBoost-derived depression model consisted of 18 factors with an area under the weighted receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86. Two nonmodel factors could be found using the model factors, and the factors were classified into direct (P<.05) and indirect (P≥.05), according to the statistical significance of the association with depression. Perceived stress and asthma were the most remarkable risk factors, and urine specific gravity was a novel protective factor. The depression-factor network showed clusters of socioeconomic status and quality of life factors and suggested that educational level and sex might be predisposing factors. Indirect factors (eg, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking) were involved in confounding or interaction effects of direct factors. Triglyceride level was a confounder of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, smoking had a significant risk in females, and weight gain was associated with depression involving diabetes. Conclusions: XGBoost and network analysis were useful to discover depression-related factors and their relationships and can be applied to epidemiological studies using big survey data. © Sang Min Nam, Thomas A Peterson, Kyoung Yul Seo, Hyun Wook Han, Jee In Kang.

Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered “important” if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha−1, 276–345 kg ha−1, and 0.44–0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha−1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha−1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers’ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg ha−1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data. © 2022 The Authors","Accumulated local effect plot; Big data; Interaction strength; Partial dependency plot; Quantile regression; Random forest; Variable importance","crop yield; disease incidence; machine learning; productivity; regression; India"

They produce robust results with a high level of accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not provide human-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions. They usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions have been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received much interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for decision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture, related domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to background knowledge. The application of the data mining process on agricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain. In this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an XAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only consider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the semantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map model, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to provide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values contribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on providing consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and values involved in the data mining models. We built an Agriculture Computing Ontology (AgriComO) to explain the knowledge mined in agriculture.

But before CNNs can join the nuclear forensics toolbox along more traditional analytical techniques – such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry, mass spectrometry, radiation counting, and any number of spectroscopic methods – a deeper understanding of “black box” image classification will be required. This paper explores uncertainty quantification for convolutional neural networks and their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) image data sets. For prediction uncertainty, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout and random image crops as variational inference techniques are implemented and characterized. Convolutional neural networks and classifiers using image features from unsupervised vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) are trained using SEM images of pure, unaged, unmixed uranium ore concentrates considered “unperturbed.” OOD data sets are developed containing perturbations from the training data with respect to the chemical and physical properties of the UOCs or data collection parameters; predictions made on the perturbation sets identify where significant shortcomings exist in the current training data and techniques used to develop models for classifying uranium process history, and provides valuable insights into how datasets and classification models can be improved for better generalizability to out-of-distribution examples. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Image classification; Machine learning; Nuclear forensics; Uncertainty quantification; Uranium chemistry",

In this context, this work presents an Internet of things (IoT)-based system integrating low-power wide area (LPWA) technology, cloud, and virtualization services to provide real-time livestock location monitoring.

In this regard, the synergy of optical and Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables a broad representation of biophysical and structural information on target objects, enhancing crop type mapping. However, the fusion of multi-sensor dense time-series data often comes with the challenge of high dimensional feature space. In this study, we (1) evaluate how the usage of only optical, only SAR, and their fusion affect the classification accuracy; (2) identify the combination of which time-steps and feature-sets lead to peak accuracy; (3) analyze misclassifications based on the parcel size, optical data availability, and crops' temporal profiles. Two fusion approaches were considered and compared in this study: feature stacking and decision fusion. To distinguish the most relevant feature subsets time- and variable-wise, grouped forward feature selection (gFFS) was used. gFFS allows focusing analysis and interpretation on feature sets of interest like spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), or data sensing time rather than on single features. This feature selection strategy leads to better interpretability of results while substantially reducing computational expenses. The results showed that, in contrast to most other studies, SAR datasets outperform optical datasets. Similar to most other studies, the optical-SAR combination outperformed single sensor predictions. No significant difference was recorded between feature stacking and decision fusion. Random Forest (RF) appears to be robust to high feature space dimensionality. The feature selection did not improve the accuracies even for the optical-SAR feature stack with 320 features. Nevertheless, the combination of RF feature importance and time- and variable-wise gFFS rankings in one visualization enhances interpretability and understanding of the features' relevance for specific classification tasks. For example, by enabling the identification of features that have high RF feature importance values but are, in their information content, correlated with other features. This study contributes to the growing domain of interpretable machine learning. ©","Crop mapping; Decision fusion; Feature stacking; Group-wise forward feature selection; Interpretable machine learning; Optical-SAR synergy","Crops; Decision trees; Sensor data fusion; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification accuracy; Computational expense; Crop type classification; Earth observation data; Forward feature selections; High-dimensional feature space; Information contents; Structural information; Feature extraction"

There are many companies in Japan that manufacture thousands of bento every day. The market for the food delivery industry is expanding in Japan. This study focuses on the catered bento industry, which delivers and manufactures bento. A method for estimating the popularity of a product is developed based on data on bento sales volume. The study proposes a demand forecasting model that takes into account the estimated popularity. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed prediction model, numerical experiments are conducted using real data provided by a company that delivers and manufactures bento.

Thus, the efforts of farmers waiting for harvests throughout the season are not wasted. In this study, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for a disease identification task in which the network comprises only six layers, which is why it is computationally inexpensive in terms of the parameters employed in the network. This network was trained using PlantVillage's tomato crop dataset, which consisted of 10 classes (nine diseases and one healthy). The proposed network was first compared with the well-known pre-trained ImageNet deep networks using a transfer learning approach. The results show that the proposed network performs better than pre-trained knowledge transferred deep network models, and that there is no need to constitute very large, complicated network architectures to achieve superior tomato disease identification performance. Furthermore, data augmentation techniques are employed during network training to improve the performance of the proposed network. The proposed network achieved an accuracy of the F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient, true positive rate, and true negative rate of 99.70%, 98.49%, 98.31%, 98.49%, and 99.81%, respectively, using 9,077 unseen test images.

Such explanations would benefit users of recommendation systems by empowering them with justifications for following the system's suggestions. We present the Food Explanation Ontology (FEO) that provides a formalism for modeling explanations to users for food-related recommendations. FEO models food recommendations, using concepts from the explanation domain to create responses to user questions about food recommendations they receive from AI systems such as personalized knowledge base question answering systems. FEO uses a modular, extensible structure that lends itself to a variety of explanations while still preserving important semantic details to accurately represent explanations of food recommendations. In order to evaluate this system, we used a set of competency questions derived from explanation types present in literature that are relevant to food recommendations. Our motivation with the use of FEO is to empower users to make decisions about their health, fully equipped with an understanding of the AI recommender systems as they relate to user questions, by providing reasoning behind their recommendations in the form of explanations.

The system provides a rationale for judging the results of advertising classification and exaggerated advertisements. Therefore, the user may know why his or her writing is classified as exaggerated advertisement.

Canopy spectral response in visible near-infrared (VNIR, 400–979 nm) has been widely used to estimate CNC and AGB of canopies but is often confounded by the soil background, crop type, phenological changes and environmental conditions. Machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as promising techniques for mapping CNC and AGB using canopy spectral reflectance in VNIR. However, ML and DL models’ performance relies on extensive labelled training datasets, which are often limited due to being expensive and labour intensive. We estimated CNC and AGB using state-of-the-art hyperspectral (HS) modeling approaches using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D and 2D CNN). These models, together with multispectral (MS) approaches, were evaluated in the context of a small (422) dataset for model development collected from diverse fertilization and contrasting growth conditions. A handheld field spectroradiometer was used to collect spectral reflectance samples across a wide range (more than ten-fold difference in AGB) of canopy development stages in two seasons (winter and summer) in ryegrass, and across phenological stages (from GS-25 to GS-60) in barley. Results can be summarized in four components: (1) the median values of performance metrics in 1D CNN (R2test=0.83, NRMSEtest=0.15 for CNC; R2test=0.79 (ryegrass), 0.61 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.29 (ryegrass), 0.30 (barley) for AGB) and PLSR (R2test=0.71, NRMSEtest= 0.20 for CNC; R2test=0.62 (ryegrass), 0.70 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.38 (ryegrass), 0.27 (barley) for AGB) showed the best performance for CNC and AGB prediction in the test data; (2) when evaluated with the independent measurements, 1D CNN demonstrated the best (up to 56% decrease in NRMSE) performance for AGB and was comparable to PLSR for CNC (up to 25% decrease in NRMSE than their HS and MS counterparts); (3) predictive models underperformed at low canopy cover for CNC estimation and were adversely affected by the high biomass saturation effects for AGB prediction; and (4) visible spectrum is relatively more informative to CNC models whereas the red edge to NIR spectrum is more informative to AGB models.

The effectiveness and interpretability of these handcrafted features depends on the expertise of the people designing them. Neural networks have the ability to learn features directly from input data and train the feature learning and prediction steps simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate the performance and interpretability of neural network models for crop yield forecasting using data from the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The selected neural networks can handle sequential or time series data and include long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN). Performance was compared with a linear trend model and a Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) model, trained using hand-designed features. Feature importance scores of input variables were computed using feature attribution methods and were analyzed by crop yield modeling and agronomy experts. Results showed that LSTM models perform statistically better than GBDT models for soft wheat in Germany and similar to GBDT models for all other case studies. In addition, LSTM models captured the effect of yield trend, static features (e.g. elevation, soil water holding capacity) and biomass features on crop yield well, but struggled to capture the impact of extreme temperature and moisture conditions.

Our study focuses on documenting how WIC's infant health effects vary by level of risk. In doing so, we leverage a uniquely rich database describing maternal and infant outcomes and risk factors. Additionally, we use high dimensional data to generate predictions of risk and combine these predictions with the novel double machine learning method to stratify the effects of WIC by predicted risk.

The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test R-squared (R2) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems. © 2021 Michael Peichl et al.",,"Crops; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Linear systems; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural productions; Clusterings; Machine learning methods; Mechanism of action; Non linear system; Non-linear damages; Seasonality; Spectra's; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Soil moisture; assessment method; crop yield; machine learning; soil moisture; soil water; wheat; Germany"

For plant disease automatic identification, classification of plant leaf images based on deep learning algorithms is currently the most accurate and popular method. Existing methods rely on the collection of large amounts of image annotation data and cannot flexibly adjust recognition categories, whereas we develop a new image retrieval system for automated detection, localization, and identification of individual leaf disease in an open setting, namely, where newly added disease types can be identified without retraining. In this paper, we first optimize the YOLOv5 algorithm, enhancing recognition ability in small objects, which helps to extract leaf objects more accurately; secondly, integrating classification recognition with metric learning, jointly learning categorizing images and similarity measurements, thus, capitalizing on prediction ability of available image classification models; and finally, constructing an efficient and nimble image retrieval system to quickly determine leaf disease type. We demonstrate detailed experimental results on three publicly available leaf disease datasets and prove the effectiveness of our system.

In Lake Tinnsjøen, one of the largest and deepest lakes in Norway, the salmonid fish, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)), has likely radiated within 9,700 years after deglaciation into ecologically and genetically segregated Piscivore, Planktivore, Dwarf, and Abyssal morphs in the pelagial, littoral, shallow-moderate profundal, and deep-profundal habitats. We compared trait variation in the size of the head, the eye and olfactory organs, as well as the volumes of five brain regions of these four Arctic charr morphs. We hypothesised that specific habitat characteristics have promoted divergent body, head, and brain sizes related to utilized depth differing in environmental constraints (e.g., light, oxygen, pressure, temperature, and food quality). The most important ecomorphological variables differentiating morphs were eye area, habitat, and number of lamellae. The Abyssal morph living in the deepest areas of the lake had the smallest brain region volumes, head, and eye size. Comparing the olfactory bulb with the optic tectum in size, it was larger in the Abyssal morph than in the Piscivore morph. The Piscivore and Planktivore morphs that use more illuminated habitats have the largest optic tectum volume, followed by the Dwarf. The observed differences in body size and sensory capacities in terms of vision and olfaction in shallow and deepwater morphs likely relates to foraging and mating habitats in Lake Tinnsjøen.

The proposed system’s prototype was tested under real conditions at the geriatric department of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Hospital. The subjects of this study were 83 geriatric patients with various health conditions. The assessments of the nutritional status and syndromes of the patients provided by the CDSS were compared with the diagnoses of the physicians obtained using standard assessment methods.

In recent span, animation has been employed in various fields to enhance knowledge, marketing, advertisement, and age groups from infants to adults. The present communication expounds the systematic review on the impact created by animation on the viewer's visual attention. For this review, a database such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, and IEEE Xplore were pursued for publications on the impact of animation on viewer's visual attention from January 2015 to December 2021. The search results showcased 175 titles with 114 full articles, out of which 35 were related to viewers' visual attention towards animation. These reviewed studies comprised of physical outcome (n=9), psychological outcome (n=15), and cognitive outcome (n=11) from which the attention-related factors, physical effects, and cognitive effects of animation were assessed. The animation has influenced the viewer's visual attention through the integration of the different stimuli and the highly organized presentation. Furthermore, the animation has also aided the viewer in attaining greater conceptual understanding, thereby facilitating their cognitive response. As a result, the animation was found to be helpful in enhancing learning skills, food marketing, and teaching strategy. Furthermore, the drawbacks and future recommendations of the studies were elaborated. In addition, challenges and open issues faced during the studies were discussed. Finally, the priority areas in animation identified for promising future directions to visualize large pool data, provide smart communication, and design 3D modeling structures were highlighted. © 2022 C.

We compared the abilities of features to compress health deficit data and to predict adverse outcomes. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and several other dimensionality reduction techniques, together with several varieties of the frailty index (FI). We observed that the FI approximates the first — primary — component obtained by PCA and other compression techniques. Most adverse outcomes were well predicted using only the FI. While the FI is therefore a useful technique for compressing binary deficits into a single variable, additional dimensions were needed for high-fidelity compression of health deficit data. Moreover, some outcomes — including inflammation and metabolic dysfunction — showed high-dimensional behaviour. We generally found that clinical data were easier to compress than lab data. Our results help to explain the success of the FI as a simple dimensionality reduction technique for binary health data. We demonstrate how PCA extends the FI, providing additional health information, and allows us to explore system dimensionality and complexity.

Combining the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003/2004 and 2005/2006 cross-sectional aging studies (N = 9307), we investigated the effects of both real and simulated missing data on the Frailty Index (FI) and survival analysis, along with several mitigation strategies. We observed distinct block patterns of missing variables in the dataset. These blocks showed significant hazard rate (HR) differences when they were missing versus present, indicating that missingness cannot be simply ignored. Simulations of this patterned missingness produced a bias of 0.0112 ± 0.0008 to the mean FI when missing values were ignored, representing a change in hazard of 1.09 ± 0.01. A similar bias of 0.0106 ± 0.0001 was estimated in the real missingness. Imputation was able to correct the bias using the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) method via the classification and regression tree (CART) prediction model together with rule-based imputation. Using auxiliary variables (CART+Aux) improved the performance of CART. Well-performing imputation models, especially CART+Aux, were able to increase the FI predictive power and the reliability of the HR estimates. In contrast, the default MICE models, predictive mean matching/logistic regression (PMM/logreg), caused even stronger biases to the FI. Our results demonstrate that calibration of the FI as a mortality predictor depends on how missing data are handled. Ignoring missing values when calculating the FI may be an acceptable strategy for clinical settings where the FI is used as a rough predictor of adverse outcomes. Where the FI is to be compared across studies or populations, judicious imputation — cognizant of the risks carried by poor imputation — should be used to ensure reliability and precision of statistical estimates and conclusions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association.","CART; Frailty Index; Imputation; MICE; Missing data; Survival","adult; aged; aging; Article; cross-sectional study; female; follow up; Frailty Index; functional status assessment; human; male; mortality rate; prediction; risk assessment; risk factor; survival rate; computer simulation; frailty; nutrition; reproducibility; statistical analysis; Computer Simulation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Frailty; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Reproducibility of Results"

As more pavements get created, it becomes increasingly difficult for water to soak into the ground and this causes a decrease in the water table. Impervious structures like streets and roofs when washed with rain deposit excessive pollutants in water bodies. The overall increase in water pollution is a potential health hazard for humans and aquatic life. Hence it is necessary to take adequate measures for addressing the water pollution issue that may potentially arise due to increased urbanization. In this study, we tackle the issue using two approaches. The first approach deals with analyzing the water quality to determine its potability using fifteen different types of machine learning techniques like random forests, decision trees, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, etc. The model has been evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F-1 score. The second approach deals with identifying marine litter from beaches in many parts of the world using machine learning algorithms. We also explore the different types of beach environments and the type of litter that is found in different locations using extensive exploratory analysis.

This study develops and applies two novel deep learning (DL) models, a residual long short-term memory (Res-LSTM) network, and a residual gated recurrent unit (Res-GRU) model, in estimating the spatial and temporal variations of salinity. Four other machine learning (ML) models, previously developed and reported, consisting of multi-layer perceptron (MLP), residual network (ResNet), LSTM, and GRU are utilized as the baseline models to benchmark the performance of the two novel models. All six models are applied at 23 study locations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (Delta), the hub of California’s water supply system. Model input features include observed or calculated tidal stage (water level), flow and salinity at model upstream boundaries, salinity control gate operations, crop consumptive use, and pumping for the period of 2001–2019. Meanwhile, field observations of salinity at the study locations during the same period are also utilized for the development of the predictive use of the models. Results indicate that the proposed DL models generally outperform the baseline models in simulating and predicting salinity on both daily and hourly scales at the study locations. The absolute bias is generally less than 5%. The correlation coefficients and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values are close to 1. Particularly, Res-LSTM has slightly superior performance over Res-GRU. Moreover, the study investigates the overfitting issues of both the DL and baseline models. The investigation indicates that overfitting is not notable. Finally, the study compares the performance of Res-LSTM against that of an operational process-based salinity model. It is shown Res-LSTM outperforms the process-based model consistently across all study locations. Overall, the study demonstrates the feasibility of DL-based models in supplementing the existing operational models in providing accurate and real-time estimates of salinity to inform water management decision making. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; explainable artificial intelligence; Res-GRU; Res-LSTM; Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta; salinity estimation and forecasting","Benchmarking; Decision making; Learning systems; Location; Water levels; Water management; Water supply; Baseline models; Deep learning; Explainable artificial intelligence; Learning models; Performance; Residual gated recurrent unit; Residual long short-term memory; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; Salinity estimation and forecasting; Salinity models; Long short-term memory; artificial intelligence; environmental protection; forecasting method; machine learning; water management; California; San Joaquin Delta; United States"

This urges the breeding of PM resistant crop cultivars and the development of management practices. A major bottleneck is the accuracy and efficiency of image analysis at the microscopic level, which is essential to understand PM infection and accelerate crop breeding and management practice development. The overall goal of this study was to develop a deep learning-based saliency map approach that can quantify PM infection in images of high spatial resolution. A subset of a total of 2690 images of 1-cm leaf disks was randomly selected to extract a total of 21,162 image patches of 224×224 pixels. A custom thresholding method was used to mask out irrelevant background information from a leaf disk image. The remaining image part was cropped into image patches of 224×224 pixels to be classified by pretrained CNN classifiers. For the patches predicted as infected, patch saliency maps were generated using several saliency methods. All patch saliency maps were re-assembled to construct a leaf-level infection map for the quantification of PM infection in leaf disk images. Experimental results showed that with a well-trained CNN classifier (validation accuracy of 95.66%), our approach achieved remarkable accuracy of the localization and quantification of PM hyphae by using only patch-level class annotations, suggesting a great potential of reducing annotation cost for deep learning-based quantification. Compared with the manual assessment, our approach also improved the processing speed by 20 to 60 times.

Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the microbial community and volatile and non-volatile compounds during the traditional fermentation of golden pomfret, focusing on amino acid metabolism. Thirty-five volatile compounds were detected. Glutamate, alanine, and leucine were the main amino acids responsible for the development of the characteristic taste of fermented golden pomfret. Metagenomic analyses were performed, and microbial genes for amino acid metabolism were functionally annotated, revealing the underlying mechanisms of flavor development during fish fermentation. Halobacterium, Clostridium, Natrinema, Alkalibacillus, Natrialba, and Vibrio were the dominant microbial genera with a major contribution to amino acid metabolism during fermentation and were strongly correlated with the majority of volatile compounds.

Its evolution over the previous two decades can be seen as the pinnacle of computer vision advancement. The detection of objects can be done via digital image processing. Machine learning has achieved significant advances in the field of digital image processing in current years, significantly outperforming previous techniques. One of the techniques that is popular is Few-Shot Learning (FSL). FSL is a type of meta-learning in which a learner is given practice on several related tasks during the meta-training phase to be able to generalize successfully to new but related activities with a limited number of instances during the meta-testing phase. Here, the application of FSL in smart agriculture, with particular in the detection and classification is reported. The aim is to review the state of the art of currently available FSL models, networks, classifications, and offer some insights into possible future avenues of research. It is found that FSL shows a higher accuracy of 99.48% in vegetable disease recognition on a limited dataset. It is also shown that FSL is reliable to use with very few instances and less training time.

However, knowledge about spatial patterns of agricultural frontier dynamics, their leading spatial determinants, and socio-ecological trade-offs is often lacking, hindering contextualized decision making towards more sustainable food systems. Here, we used inventory data to map frontier dynamics of avocado production, a cash crop of increasing importance in global diets, for Michoacán, Mexico, before and after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). We compiled a set of environmental, accessibility and social variables and identified the leading determinants of avocado frontier expansion and their interactions using extreme gradient boosting. We predicted potential expansion patterns and assessed their impacts on areas important for biodiversity conservation. Avocado frontiers expanded more than tenfold from 12,909 ha (1974) to 152,493 ha (2011), particularly after NAFTA. Annual precipitation, distance to settlements, and land tenure were key factors explaining avocado expansion. Under favorable climatic and accessibility conditions, most avocado expansion occurred on private lands. Contrary, under suboptimal conditions, most avocado expansion occurred on communal lands. Large areas suitable for further avocado expansion overlapped with priority sites for restoration, highlighting an imminent conflict between conservation and economic revenues. This is the first analysis of avocado frontier dynamics and their spatial determinants across a major production region and our results provide entry points to implement government-based strategies to support small-scale farmers, mostly those on communal lands, while trying to minimize the socio-environmental impacts of avocado production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural expansion; Commodity frontiers; Extreme gradient boosting; Globalization; NAFTA",

In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security. © Copyright © 2021 Razzaq, Kaur, Akhter, Wani and Saleem.","abiotic stress; climate change; CRISPR/Cas; crop improvement; food security; genome editing; genomics; next-generation breeding",

Closed plant production systems (CPPSs) allow growing of any plant variety, no matter the year’s season. Artificial lighting plays an essential role in CPPSs as it promotes growth by providing optimal conditions for plant development. Nevertheless, it is a model with a high demand for electricity, which is required for artificial radiation systems to enhance the developing plants. A high percentage (40% to 50%) of the costs in CPPSs point to artificial lighting systems. Due to this, lighting strategies are essential to improve sustainability and profitability in closed plant production systems. However, no tools have been applied in the literature to contribute to energy savings in LED-type artificial radiation systems through the configuration of light recipes (wavelengths combination. For CPPS to be cost-effective and sustainable, a pre-evaluation of energy consumption for plant cultivation must consider. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods integrated into the prediction crucial variables such as each input-variable light color or specific wavelengths like red, green, blue, and white along with light intensity (quantity), frequency (pulsed light), and duty cycle. This paper focuses on the feature-selection stage, in which a regression model is trained to predict energy consumption in LED lights with specific light recipes in CPPSs. This stage is critical because it identifies the most representative features for training the model, and the other stages depend on it. These tools can enable further in-depth analysis of the energy savings that can be obtained with light recipes and pulsed and continuous operation light modes in artificial LED lighting systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Applications such as object (e.g., ship or vehicle) detection directly translate from their military counterparts of airborne and ground-based automatic target recognition (ATR). However, most applications involving the remote sensing of the environment fundamentally reverse the way radar backscattering is perceived. In detection and recognition, scattering from any surface other than the object is regarded as “clutter”- undesirable reflections that ought to be removed or suppressed in the data so that the true nature of the object of interest can be ascertained. However, in environmental remote sensing, it is the surface or volume scattering that we seek to understand and exploit. In many cases, remote sensing aims at extracting geophysical properties, which can be related back to the way materials interact with electromagnetic waves. Examples include soil moisture or water concentration, terrain elevation, biomass, mass movement rates, hydrometeor type, plant health, drought tolerance, crop yield, ice layers, and snow thickness. Because deep learning (DL) was originally developed in consideration of real-valued data and optical images, the potential performance, architectures, and optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) operating on radar remote sensing data must be reassessed. The relationship between geophysical properties, electromagnetic scattering, and the RF data representations used to reveal these relationships creates vast, complex, multidimensional, and time-varying datasets over which DL can be leveraged. Thus, the rich and unique qualities of remote sensing data present new challenges for DL, which has driven much research in this area.

With the development of automated machine learning, agricultural experts are now able to train, evaluate and make predictions using cutting edge machine learning (ML) models without the need for much ML knowledge. Although this automated approach has led to successful results in many scenarios, in certain cases (e.g., when few labeled datasets are available) choosing among different models with similar performance metrics is a difficult task. Furthermore, these systems do not commonly allow users to incorporate their domain knowledge that could facilitate the task of model selection, and to gain insight into the prediction system for eventual decision making. To address these issues, in this paper we present AHMoSe, a visual support system that allows domain experts to better understand, diagnose and compare different regression models, primarily by enriching model-agnostic explanations with domain knowledge. To validate AHMoSe, we describe a use case scenario in the viticulture domain, grape quality prediction, where the system enables users to diagnose and select prediction models that perform better.

The purpose of this study is to illustrate the potential of a convolutional neural network model to assess the risk of hip dislocation based on postoperative anteroposterior pelvis radiographs. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated radiographs for a cohort of 13,970 primary THAs with 374 dislocations over 5 years of follow-up. Overall, 1490 radiographs from dislocated and 91,094 from non-dislocated THAs were included in the analysis. A convolutional neural network object detection model (YOLO-V3) was trained to crop the images by centering on the femoral head. A ResNet18 classifier was trained to predict subsequent hip dislocation from the cropped imaging. The ResNet18 classifier was initialized with ImageNet weights and trained using FastAI (V1.0) running on PyTorch. The training was run for 15 epochs using 10-fold cross validation, data oversampling, and augmentation. Results: The hip dislocation classifier achieved the following mean performance (standard deviation): accuracy = 49.5 (4.1%), sensitivity = 89.0 (2.2%), specificity = 48.8 (4.2%), positive predictive value = 3.3 (0.3%), negative predictive value = 99.5 (0.1%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 76.7 (3.6%). Saliency maps demonstrated that the model placed the greatest emphasis on the femoral head and acetabular component. Conclusion: Existing prediction methods fail to identify patients at high risk of dislocation following THA. Our radiographic classifier model has high sensitivity and negative predictive value, and can be combined with clinical risk factor information for rapid assessment of risk for dislocation following THA. The model further suggests radiographic locations which may be important in understanding the etiology of prosthesis dislocation. Importantly, our model is an illustration of the potential of automated imaging artificial intelligence models in orthopedics.

However, many models are typically black boxes, meaning we cannot explain what the models learned from the data and the reasons behind predictions. To address this issue, I introduce an emerging subdomain of artificial intelligence, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and associated toolkits, interpretable machine learning. This study demonstrates the usefulness of several methods by applying them to an openly available dataset. The dataset includes the no-tillage effect on crop yield relative to conventional tillage and soil, climate, and management variables. Data analysis discovered that no-tillage management can increase maize crop yield where yield in conventional tillage is <5000 kg/ha and the maximum temperature is higher than 32°. These methods are useful to answer (i) which variables are important for prediction in regression/classification, (ii) which variable interactions are important for prediction, (iii) how important variables and their interactions are associated with the response variable, (iv) what are the reasons underlying a predicted value for a certain instance, and (v) whether different machine learning algorithms offer the same answer to these questions. I argue that the goodness of model fit is overly evaluated with model performance measures in the current practice, while these questions are unanswered.

Internet of Things (IoT) based smart agriculture system can play a vital role in optimising crop yield by managing crop requirements in real-Time. Interpretability can be an important factor to make such systems trusted and easily adopted by farmers. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based agriculture system that uses IoT data to monitor the environment and alerts farmers to take the required actions for maintaining ideal conditions for crop production. The strength of the proposed system is in its interpretability which makes it easy for farmers to understand, trust and use it. The use of fuzzy logic makes the system customisable in terms of types/number of sensors, type of crop, and adaptable for any soil types and weather conditions. The proposed system can identify anomalous data due to security breaches or hardware malfunction using machine learning algorithms. To ensure the viability of the system we have conducted thorough research related to agricultural factors such as soil type, soil moisture, soil temperature, plant life cycle, irrigation requirement and water application timing for Maize as our target crop. The experimental results show that our proposed system is interpretable, can detect anomalous data, and triggers actions accurately based on crop requirements. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Our understanding of nitrate dynamics has advanced substantially in the past decades, although its predominant drivers across gradients of climate, land use, and geology have remained elusive. Here we collated nitrate data from 2061 rivers along with 32 watershed characteristic indexes and developed machine learning models to reconstruct long-term mean (multi-year average) nitrate concentrations in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The trained models show similarly satisfactory model performance and can predict nitrate concentrations in chemically-ungauged places with about 70% accuracy. Further analysis revealed that five (out of 32) indexes (drivers) can explain about 70% of spatial variations in mean nitrate concentrations. The five influential drivers are nitrogen application rates Nrate and urban area Aurban% (human drivers), mean annual precipitation and temperature (climate drivers), and sand percent Sand% (soil property driver). Nitrate concentrations in undeveloped sites are primarily modulated by climate and soil property; they decrease with increasing mean discharge and Sand%. Nitrate concentrations in agriculture and urban sites increase with Nrate and Aurban% until reaching their apparent maxima around 10,000 kg/km2/yr and around 25%, respectively. Results indicate that nitrate concentrations may remain similar or increase with growing human population. In addition, nitrate concentrations can increase even without human input, as warming escalates water demand and reduces mean discharge in many places. These results allude to a conceptual model that highlights the impacts of distinct drivers: while human drivers predominate nitrogen input to land and rivers, climate drivers and soil properties modulate its transport and transformation, the balance of which determine long-term mean concentrations.

Therefore, in this paper, we surveyed the concept of a personal digital twin (PDT) as an enhanced version of the DT with actionable insight capabilities. In particular, PDT can bring value to patients by enabling more accurate decision making and proper treatment selection and optimisation. Then, we explored the progression of PDT as a revolutionary technology in healthcare research and industry. However, although several research works have been performed for smart healthcare using DT, PDT is still at an early stage. Consequently, we believe that this work can be a step towards smart personalised healthcare industry by guiding the design of industrial personalised healthcare systems. Accordingly, we introduced a reference framework that empowers smart personalised healthcare using PDTs by bringing together existing advanced technologies (i.e., DT, blockchain, and AI). Then, we described some selected use cases, including the mitigation of COVID-19 contagion, COVID-19 survivor follow-up care, personalised COVID-19 medicine, personalised osteoporosis prevention, personalised cancer survivor follow-up care, and personalised nutrition.

Interactions among different genetic, environmental, and management factors and uncertainty in input values are making crop yield prediction complex. Building upon a previous work in which we coupled crop modeling with machine learning (ML) models to predict maize yields for three US Corn Belt states, here, we expand the concept to the entire US Corn Belt (12 states). More specifically, we built five new ML models and their ensemble models, considering the scenarios with and without crop modeling variables. Additional input values in our models are soil, weather, management, and historical yield data. A unique aspect of our work is the spatial analysis to investigate causes for low or high model prediction errors. Our results indicated that the prediction accuracy increases by coupling crop modeling with machine learning. The ensemble model overperformed the individual ML models, having a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of about 9% for the test years (2018, 2019, and 2020), which is comparable to previous studies. In addition, analysis of the sources of error revealed that counties and crop reporting districts with low cropland ratios have high RRMSE. Furthermore, we found that soil input data and extreme weather events were responsible for high errors in some regions. The proposed models can be deployed for large-scale prediction at the county level and, contingent upon data availability, can be utilized for field level prediction.

In this paper, we propose a crop yield prediction model which integrates the outputs from a crop simulation model (APSIM). These outputs are included as features in the machine learning (ML) models to improve the transparency and an ensemble model then is designed for prediction. The proposed model is applied to predict the corn yield of 12 US Corn Belt States. RRMSE of 9.34%, 8.99%, and 9.52% was achieved after evaluating the model at the county level for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively. The proposed model has similar accuracy as the top-performing state-of-art prediction models while providing interpretability. Additional analyses have been conducted to understand the source of model errors.

Therefore, measures need to be taken to overcome these challenges and gain better knowledge of crop dynamics. The arrival of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) has enabled us to propose a Sentinel-2 (S2) phenology end-to-end processing chain. To achieve this, the following pipeline was implemented: (1) the building of hybrid Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) retrieval models of crop traits optimized with active learning, (2) implementation of these models on GEE (3) generation of spatiotemporally continuous maps and time series of these crop traits with the use of gap-filling through GPR fitting, and finally, (4) calculation of land surface phenology (LSP) metrics such as the start of season (SOS) or end of season (EOS). Overall, from good to high performance was achieved, in particular for the estimation of canopy-level traits such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content, with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 9% and 10%, respectively. By means of the GPR gap-filling time series of S2, entire tiles were reconstructed, and resulting maps were demonstrated over an agricultural area in Castile and Leon, Spain, where crop calendar data were available to assess the validity of LSP metrics derived from crop traits. In addition, phenology derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as reference. NDVI not only proved to be a robust indicator for the calculation of LSP metrics, but also served to demonstrate the good phenology quality of the quantitative trait products. Thanks to the GEE framework, the proposed workflow can be realized anywhere in the world and for any time window, thus representing a shift in the satellite data processing paradigm. We anticipate that the produced LSP metrics can provide meaningful insights into crop seasonal patterns in a changing environment that demands adaptive agricultural production. © 2021 by the authors.

To put this into perspective, the Italian government has recently established an ambitious goal to support the wider uptake of advanced second-generation biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels for the transportation sector. A sustainable way forward is to grow perennial biomass crops on marginal lands, however the nationwide availability of those lands for lignocellulosic feedstock production remains uncertain. We identify and evaluate the potential of marginal lands in Italy to produce sizeable amounts of biomass for sustainable cellulosic biofuel production while limiting land use conflicts and negative ecological impacts. We applied spatial multi-criteria decision analysis techniques in geographic information systems to ultimately generate spatially-explicit national land suitability and availability maps at a fine resolution (250-m). We selected a broad range of leading cellulosic biomass crops that includes poplar (Populus × canadensis Moench), willow (Salix alba Linnaeus), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia Linnaeus), giant reed (Arundo donax Linnaeus), and vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides Linnaeus). Based on marginality criteria, our results suggest that such biomass plantations of perennial grasses and short rotation trees may produce 3.1–27.4 billion liters of cellulosic ethanol per year from 462,265 to 2,811,064 million hectares of available marginal lands. This estimated production may fulfill 7.8–69.1% of Italy's current liquid transportation fuel consumption, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 70 km of a potential cellulosic biorefinery. Collectively, this study provides the cornerstone of efforts to rationally meet Italy's need for renewable fuels in a sustainable low-carbon economy future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cellulosic feedstocks; Environmental sustainability; Land availability; Perennial grasses; Renewable bioenergy; Short rotation trees","biofuel; cellulose; decision analysis; multicriteria analysis; renewable resource; sustainability; Italy"

The variety of processed data raises unique questions regarding the interplay of multiple regulatory systems alongside food safety legislation. Provisions aiming to preserve the confidentiality of data and protect personal information are juxtaposed to norms prescribing the public disclosure of scientific information. This research is intended to provide guidance for data governance and data ownership issues that unfold from the ongoing transformation of the technical and legal domains of food safety risk assessment. Following the reconstruction of technological advances in data collection and analysis and the description of recent amendments to food safety legislation, emerging concerns are discussed in light of the individual, collective and social implications of the deployment of cutting-edge Big Data collection and analysis techniques. Then, a set of principle-based recommendations is proposed by adapting high-level principles enshrined in institutional documents about Artificial Intelligence to the realm of food safety risk assessment.

For many entities, this decision is difficult and we need another class called “maybe”, which contains a corresponding quantifiable tendency toward one of these two opposites. Human domain experts are often able to mark any entity, place it in a different class and adjust the position of the slope in the class. Moreover, they can often explain the classification space linguistically—depending on their individual domain experience and previous knowledge. We consider this human-in-the-loop extremely important and call our approach actionable explainable AI. Consequently, the parameters of the functions are adapted to these requirements and the solution is explained to the domain experts accordingly. Specifically, this paper contains three novelties going beyond the state-of-the-art: (1) A novel method for detecting the appropriate parameter range for the averaging function to treat the slope in the “maybe” class, along with a proposal for a better generalisation than the existing solution. (2) the insight that for a given problem, the family of t-norms and t-conorms covering the whole range of nilpotency is suitable because we need a clear “no” or “yes” not only for the borderline cases. Consequently, we adopted the Schweizer–Sklar family of t-norms or t-conorms in ordinal sums.

In this work, the volatile organic compounds obtained from the headspace of honey are used to prove their authenticity. The headspace of 58 honey samples was analyzed using a commercial easy-to-use gas chromatography-coupled ion mobility spectrometer with a headspace sampler (HS-GCxIMS). The honey samples were successfully differentiated by their six different botanical origins using specific markers with principal component analysis in combination with linear discriminant analysis.

The precise relationship between the risk for violent conflict and natural resources remains contested because of the interplay with socio-economic variables. This paper aims to improve the understanding of natural resources' role in the risk of violent conflicts by accounting for complex interactions with socio-economic conditions. Conflict data was analysed with machine learning techniques, which can account for complex patterns, such as variable interactions. More commonly used logistic regression models are compared with neural network models and random forest models. The results indicate that a country's natural resource features are important predictors of its risk for violent conflict and that they interact with socio-economic conditions. Based on these empirical results and the existing literature, we interpret that natural resources can be root causes of violent intrastate conflict, and that signals from natural resources leading to conflict risk are reflected in and influenced by interacting socio-economic conditions. More specifically, the results show that variables such as access to water and food security are important predictors of conflict, while resource rents and oil and ore exports are relatively less important than other natural resource variables, contrasting what prior research has suggested. Given the potential of natural resource features to act as an early warning for violent conflict, we argue that natural resources should be included in conflict risk models for conflict prevention. © 2020 by the authors.","Conflict prediction; Environmental conflict; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Natural resource conflict; Natural resources; Neural network; Random forest; Sustainable peace","conflict management; food security; machine learning; risk assessment; socioeconomic status; sustainable development; violence"

However, information about how and when this C entered the soils is limited. This study illustrates how depth profiles of organic matter can shed light on different entry paths of organic C. Methods: Machine learning was used to explain total organic C (TOC), C:N, particulate organic C (POC), δ13C and δ15N values down to 100 cm depth based on pedology, geology, climate and management-related variables from the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. We estimated TOC turnover rates based on the relationship between the proportion of maize (only C4 plant) in crop rotations and soil δ13C values. Results: In the upper 30 cm of cropland, fresh photosynthates added on average 0.2 to 0.8 Mg C ha− 1 year− 1. Organic fertiliser was another source of topsoil C, especially in grassland. Sandy sites in north-west Germany contained historic C from past heathland and peatland. One third of German agricultural land was found to be on colluvial and alluvial deposits, in which allochthonous C from upstream and upslope areas evidently increased the TOC content of subsoils. In and below hardpans, TOC content and C:N and POC:TOC ratios were low, indicating restricted root-derived C input. Conclusions: Our data indicate that ongoing management in German agricultural soils mainly affects topsoil C, while C storage in subsoils reveals significant legacies from allochthonous, buried or translocated C inputs. Specific attention should be focused on the sustainable loosening of hardpans that could result in a slow, but significant increase in subsoil C stocks. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"agricultural soil; carbon isotope; crop rotation; heathland; isotopic fractionation; machine learning; maize; nitrogen isotope; soil depth; soil organic matter; soil profile; subsoil; topsoil; Germany; Matthiola"

It can produce very large, multi-dimensional data sets that require sophisticated analysis tools, such as metamodeling. Advances in explainable artificial intelligence have expanded the types of metamodels that can be considered; however, constructing a well-fitting machine learning metamodel involves many tasks that can become time consuming for an analyst. Automated machine learning (autoML) can save an analyst time by automating metamodel training, tuning and testing. Using outputs of an agent-based simulation of a military ground-based air defense scenario, we compared the performance of metamodels trained using autoML and different experimental designs. We found that autoML can reasonably automate the construction of metamodels and adds robustness to the analysis by considering multiple types of metamodels; however, the type and size of experimental design can significantly impact metamodel performance. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Decision making; Design of experiments; Network security; Statistics; Analysis tools; Automated machines; Data farming; Data set; Decision makers; Machine-learning; Meta model; Metamodeling; Multidimensional data; Performance; Machine learning"

Hence, to reach the 2030 European energy efficiency target it is vital to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. An important barrier that hinders renovation projects is uncertainty regarding the expected savings. The main objective of this paper is to present two different statistical methods to estimate energy savings. The two methods are easy to implement for practitioners within the energy retrofitting industry, and at the same time has acceptable precision and reliability. The two methods are applied at 5 different food retail stores that undertook renovation in 2019. The models are trained on data from 2018 (one whole year before any of the retrofitting's took place) and are further applied to estimate the energy savings in 2021. The first method is the Tao Vanilla benchmarking method (TVB). The TVB model predict energy consumption in buildings on an hourly level. The model has received a lot of attention within the load forecasting literature and has previously proved its performance in machine learning competitions. The TVB has a straightforward specification, and the model parameters are easily understood. This is the first study that apply the TVB to estimate energy savings in a large retrofitting project within the energy and building sector. The second method relies on a more common industrial approach, which is to use weekly data and energy temperature curves to document energy savings. In addition, we demonstrate a novel approach of using broken line (BL) models to estimate energy savings. The suggested BL approach can simultaneously estimate all the model parameters and yield a full covariance matrix within a standard linear regression framework. The results from the retrofitting projects demonstrates considerable energy savings between 25% and 55%. Furthermore, both the TVB and the BL models deliver reliable precision. The estimated energy savings from both models are coinciding. This indicates that they could jointly be used to gain insight that may lead to more informed decisions for energy saving projects. The TVB model proves to be a proficient benchmarking model that can give detailed hourly information about the savings. The BL model is used to gain intrinsic details about the buildings varying cooling and heating needs depending on the outside temperature during the year. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Broken line models; Building energy retrofitting; Data driven models; Energy savings evaluation; Measurement and verification; Tao Vanilla Benchmark model","Benchmarking; Buildings; Covariance matrix; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Retail stores; Retrofitting; Benchmark models; Broken line model; Building energy; Building energy retrofitting; Data-driven model; Energy saving evaluation; Energy-savings; Line models; Measurement and verification; Tao vanillum benchmark model; Energy utilization"

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a “committee” of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18–24 (May 1st to June 1st) are the most important input features. © Copyright © 2020 Shahhosseini, Hu and Archontoulis.","corn yields; ensemble; forecasting; machine learning; US Corn Belt",

The sophisticated computational techniques are required for the extraction of data from these huge loads, so that refined extracted information can be easily deployable for the progress of mankind. The human protein function prediction (HPFP) is the relevant research area whose identification or function prediction leads to the discovery of drugs, detection of disease, crop hybridization, etc. Numerous approaches are present these days for HPFP because of its wide and versatile nature of this domain. The Decision tree (DT) based white box Machine Learning (ML) approaches is enriched with computational techniques to grab the information from this important research area. This study uses the decision tree based machine learning approach together with a sequence derived features (SDF’s) extraction from the human protein sequence in order to predict the protein function. The experiment has been performed by manually extracting the human protein classes and sequences from HPRD (human protein reference database) [1]. Thereafter extract the SDF’s from the sequences with the help of proposed HP-SDFE server as well as with the help of web servers and the DT based different classifiers such as boosting, winnowing, pruning etc. has been used for HPF prediction. The efficacies of different DT classifiers are examined and compared with the existing benchmark. The importance of input configurations together with enhanced SDF’s has been thoroughly examined, which leads the individual molecular class prediction accuracy to 97%.

Quantification of the magnitude and impact of freshwater nitrogen requires identifying key controls of nitrogen dynamics and analyzing both the past and present patterns of nitrogen flows. To tackle this challenge, we adopted a machine learning (ML) approach and built an ML-driven representation that captures spatiotemporal variability in nitrogen concentrations at global scale. Our model uses random forests to regress a large sample of monthly measured stream nitrogen concentrations onto a set of 17 predictors with a spatial resolution of 0.5-degree over the 1990–2013, including observations within the pixel and upstream drivers. The model was validated with data from rivers outside the training dataset and was used to predict nitrogen concentrations in 520 major river basins of the world, including many with scarce or no observations. We predicted that the regions with highest median nitrogen concentrations in their rivers (in 2013) were: United States (Mississippi), Pakistan, Bangladesh, India (Indus, Ganges), China (Yellow, Yangtze, Yongding, Huai), and most of Europe (Rhine, Danube, Vistula, Thames, Trent, Severn). Other major hotspots were the river basins of the Sebou (Morroco), Nakdong (South Korea), Kitakami (Japan), and Egypt's Nile Delta. Our analysis showed that the rate of increase in nitrogen concentration between 1990s and 2000s was greatest in rivers located in eastern China, eastern and central parts of Canada, Baltic states, Pakistan, mainland southeast Asia, and south-eastern Australia. Using a new grouped variable importance measure, we also found that temporality (month of the year and cumulative month count) is the most influential predictor, followed by factors representing hydroclimatic conditions, diffuse nutrient emissions from agriculture, and topographic features. Our model can be further applied to assess strategies designed to reduce nitrogen pollution in freshwater bodies at large spatial scales. © 2023 The Authors","Global water quality; Hotspot analysis; Nitrogen pollution; Random forests; Variable importance","Forestry; Health hazards; Health risks; Machine learning; Nitrogen; Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; Watersheds; Global water quality; Hotspot analyse; Hotspots; Machine learning approaches; Nitrogen concentrations; Nitrogen pollution; Pakistan; Random forests; River basins; Variable importances; Water quality; algorithm; concentration (composition); machine learning; nitrogen; river pollution; stream; water quality; Bangladesh; China; Danube River; Egypt; England; Ganges River; Honshu; Huai River; India; Indus River; Japan; Kitakami River; Mississippi River; Morocco; Nakdong River; Nile Delta; Pakistan; Poland [Central Europe]; Rhine River; Sebou River; Severn River [United Kingdom]; South Korea; Thames River [England]; Tohoku; Trent River [England]; United Kingdom; United States; Vistula River; Yangtze River; Yellow River; Yongding River [China]"

However, empirically measured pesticide dissipation half-lives are highly variable and the accurate prediction with models is challenging. This study utilized a dataset of pesticide dissipation half-lives containing 1363 datapoints, 311 pesticides, 10 plant types, and 4 plant component classes. Novel dissipation half-life intervals were proposed and predicted to account for high variations in empirical data. Four machine learning models (i.e., gradient boosting regression tree [GBRT], random forest [RF], supporting vector classifier [SVC], and logistic regression [LR]) were developed to predict dissipation half-life intervals using extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), temperature, plant type, and plant component class as model inputs. GBRT-ECFP had the best model performance with F1-microbinary score of 0.698 ± 0.010 for the binary classification compared with other machine learning models (e.g., LR-ECFP, F1-microbinary= 0.662 ± 0.009). Feature importance analysis of molecular structures in the binary classification identified aromatic rings, carbonyl group, organophosphate, =C-H, and N-containing heterocyclic groups as important substructures related to pesticide dissipation half-lives.

Consumer buy and pay preferences for specially labeled food products (e.g., U.S. Department of Agriculture organic, raised without antibiotics, and locally raised) may promote the adoption of associated production practices by food producers. Thus, it is important to understand how consumer buy and pay preferences for specially labeled products vary with their demographics, food-relevant habits, and foodborne disease perceptions. Using both conventional statistical and novel machine learning models, this study analyzed Michigan State University Environmental Science and Policy Program annual survey data (2019) to characterize consumer buy and pay preferences regarding eight labels related to food production practices. Older consumer age was significantly associated with lower consumer willingness to pay more for labeled products. Participants who prefer to shop in nonconventional grocery stores were more willing to buy and pay more for labeled products. Our machine learning models provide a new approach for analyzing food safety and labeling survey data and produced adequate average prediction accuracy scores for all eight labels. The label ""raised without antibiotics""had the highest average prediction accuracy for consumer willingness to buy. Thus, the machine learning models may be used to analyze food survey data and help develop strategies for promoting healthy food production practices.

In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were used in combination with climate, soil and elevation data to predict field-level sugarcane yield across the multiple sugar mill areas in the Wet Tropics of Australia at different time steps over four consecutive growing seasons (2016–2019). A total of ≈1400 field-level measurements were used to train predictive machine learning models of cane yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS, %), sugar yield (t/ha), crop varieties and ratoon numbers. We compared the predictive performance of models based on both satellite imagery only and a fusion of satellite imagery with climate, soil and topographical information. Randomized search on hyperparameters was the method used to optimize and identify the most accurate decision tree-based machine model. Overall, gradient boosting was the most accurate method for predicting sugarcane attributes. The analysis resulted in cane yield, CCS and sugar yield predicted at the field level with R2 of up to 0.51 (RMSE = 16 t/ha), 0.63 (RMSE = 1 %) and 0.62 (RMSE = 2 t/ha) as soon as four months before the harvest season. It was also found that sugarcane varieties could be mapped with an accuracy of up to 73.4 %, while the differentiation of planted and ratoon crops exhibited the lowest accuracy of 45.4 %. Using a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the output of our machine learning models we found that Sentinel-2 derived spectral indices were the most important in predicting cane yield as well as differentiating sugarcane varieties and ratoon numbers. In contrast, climate and elevation derived predictors were the most important in predicting CCS and sugar yield. At the whole sugar mill area level, spatially averaged field-level results predicted mill area cane yield, CCS and sugar yield with R2 of 0.75 (RMSE = 4.6 t/ha), 0.80 (RMSE = 0.6 %) and 0.77 (RMSE = 1 t/ha). Early season prediction of sugarcane yields at both field- and mill-area level could be valuable for informing fertilizer application, harvest scheduling and marketing decisions. © 2020","Climate; Fusion; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite; SHAP; Sugarcane; Yield","crop yield; environmental assessment; growing season; machine learning; prediction; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; sugar; sugar cane; Australia"

However, AI's use in high-value, sensitive, or safety-critical applications such as self-management for personalized health or personalized nutrition has been challenging. These require that the AI system follows guidelines or well-defined processes set by experts, community, or standards. We characterize these as process knowledge (PK). For example, to diagnose the severity of depression, the AI system should incorporate PK that is part of the clinical decision-making process, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Likewise, a nutritionist's knowledge and dietary guidelines are needed to create food plans for diabetic patients. Furthermore, the BlackBox nature of purely data-reliant statistical AI systems falls short in providing user-understandable explanations, such as what a clinician would need to ensure and document compliance with medical guidelines before relying on a recommendation. Using the examples of mental health and cooking recipes for diabetic patients, we show why, what, and how to incorporate PK along with domain knowledge in machine learning.

Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced.

The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability.

However, due to the nature of 'black-box' model representation, how to explain and interpret the learning process and the model decision, especially for vegetation classification, remains an open challenge. This study proposes a novel interpretable deep learning model - a biologically interpretable two-stage deep neural network (BIT-DNN), by incorporating the prior-knowledge (i.e., biophysical and biochemical attributes and their hierarchical structures of target entities)-based spectral-spatial feature transformation into the proposed framework, capable of achieving both high accuracy and interpretability on HSI-based classification tasks. The proposed model introduces a two-stage feature learning process: in the first stage, an enhanced interpretable feature block extracts the low-level spectral features associated with the biophysical and biochemical attributes of target entities; and in the second stage, an interpretable capsule block extracts and encapsulates the high-level joint spectral-spatial features representing the hierarchical structure of biophysical and biochemical attributes of these target entities, which provides the model an improved performance on classification and intrinsic interpretability with reduced computational complexity. We have tested and evaluated the model using four real HSI data sets for four separate tasks (i.e., plant species classification, land cover classification, urban scene recognition, and crop disease recognition tasks). The proposed model has been compared with five state-of-the-art deep learning models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model has competitive advantages in terms of both classification accuracy and model interpretability, especially for vegetation classification. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Classification; deep learning; hyper-spectral images (HSIs); interpretability","Agricultural robots; Biophysics; Classification (of information); Competition; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Agricultural monitoring; Classification accuracy; Hierarchical structures; Hyper-spectral imageries; Hyper-spectral images; Land cover classification; Monitoring applications; Vegetation classification; Deep learning; artificial neural network; data set; image classification; vegetation classification"

This study aimed to address the relationship between Sargassum distribution in the Yellow Sea (YS) and the East China Sea (ECS) and environmental variables for determining Sargassum distribution toward the Korean Peninsula. From feature importance ranking, we found that sea surface temperature (SST) is the most influential environmental variable in Sargassum distribution. From variables such as sea surface height (SSH), eastward seawater velocity (uo), and northward seawater velocity (vo), it was observed that Sargassum patches were not distributed in the southeast below 29 °N. Subsequently, we employed bagged tress models to evaluate the specific sensitivity of each environmental variable to Sargassum distribution. This model showed the best quantitative and qualitative performance when trained with physical and geographical variables. When estimating expanded areas of Sargassum distribution over time with the change in SST, a sider distribution range of Sargassum patches than usual and an early inflow into the Korean Peninsula were observed when the SST increased from the original. In addition, we found that the tolerable and favorable SST for Sargassum was 12–20 and 18°C, respectively. These results will enhance the understanding of the relationship between environmental variables and Sargassum distribution and provide valuable data for establishing a pre-disaster system for Sargassum blooms flowing toward the Korean Peninsula.

Therefore, issues usually emerge from the insistence on performing risky behaviours, such as smoking or eating fast foods, which continuously increase the gap between current and beneficial health states. This paper introduces the term “health debt” as an economic metaphor to represent the quantification of this gap in domains such as sleep, contributing to physical and mental health states. Then, we present a theoretical framework that relies on behaviour change recommendations to quantify this debt. The practical instantiation of this framework relies on passively assessed sleep related data via personal wearable devices, and uses of an attention-based predictive model as the fitness function of a genetic algorithm that acts as a recommender. We evaluate this proposal by means of a case example aimed at improving the sleep duration of individuals. Results show, for example, that the use of individual rather than generic datasets produces more accurate models. At the same time, the use of constraints on the variability of behaviours features generates more feasible recommendations. These foundations open new research opportunities to support the adoption of preventive medicine based on longitudinal wearable passive data analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)",,"Behavioral research; Deep learning; Sleep research; Wearable technology; 'current; Behaviour changes; Fast food; Health state; Human behaviors; Learning models; Mental health; Physical health; Risky behaviors; Theoretical framework; Genetic algorithms; adoption; adult; article; attention; behavior change; conceptual framework; data analysis; deep learning; female; genetic algorithm; human; human experiment; literature; male; mental health; predictive model; preventive medicine; sleep time; electronic device; exercise; sleep; Deep Learning; Exercise; Humans; Mental Health; Sleep; Wearable Electronic Devices"

In this work, we propose Deep Gravity, an effective model to generate flow probabilities that exploits many features (e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover non-linear relationships between those features and mobility flows. Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity achieves a significant increase in performance, especially in densely populated regions of interest, with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. Deep Gravity has good generalization capability, generating realistic flows also for geographic areas for which there is no data availability for training. Finally, we show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features and highlight crucial differences among the three considered countries interpreting the model’s prediction with explainable AI techniques. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"detection method; gravity; prediction; article; data availability; deep neural network; England; gravity model; health care facility; Italy; land use; New York; prediction; probability; England; Italy; New York [United States]; United Kingdom; United States"

This work proposes an ontology-based TS, namely HeNuALs, aimed at fostering a healthy diet and an active lifestyle in older adults with chronic pathologies. The system is built on the formalization of users’ health conditions, which can be obtained by leveraging existing stand-ards. This allows for modeling different pathologies via reusable knowledge, thus limiting the amount of information needed to retrieve nutritional indications from the system. HeNuALs is com-posed of (1) an ontological layer that stores patients and their data, food and its characteristics, and physical activity-related data, enabling the inference a series of suggestions based on the effects of foods and exercises on specific health conditions; (2) two applications that allow both the patient and the clinicians to access the data (with different permissions) stored in the ontological layer; and (3) a series of wearable sensors that can be used to monitor physical exercise (provided by the patient application) and to ensure patients' safety. HeNuALs inferences have been validated considering two different use cases. The system revealed the ability to determine suggestions for healthy, adequate, or unhealthy dishes for a patient with respiratory disease and for a patient with diabetes mellitus.

The quality of the agriculture is impacted by the pests and diseases infected on the plants. Many researches proposed traditional image processing techniques to identify the diseases and design a recommendation system but all these are expensive and inaccurate systems, which are not affordable by farmers. When a new era known as “Machine Learning” as evolved, researchers extracted necessary features from the plant images and converted them into csv files to classify the diseases in plants using these approaches. Even these approaches are time consuming, so researchers are moved to deep learning approaches in which the intermediate steps takes places automatically in between input and output like pre-processing feature extraction. In this paper, the model studied about different deep learning approaches available on the disease detection system in various plants. Among the deep learning models, the researchers who have implemented transfer learning approaches have obtained high accuracy and few have achieved good kappa cohen values also. In traditional models the system needs to assume random weights for the neurons to produce the dot vectors of every layers. These assumed values some times may give more error rate which results in back propagation. Transfer learning helps the model to get the optimal weights without assumptions of each neuron from the pre-trained model it implements. The major advantage of any pre-trained model lies in faster training of network with millions of different categories images. One of the popular dataset used by most of the researchers for this study is “ImageNet”.

The percent of patients identified by both the passive and active identification methods as experiencing SDOH varied from 0.3% to 4.7%. The active identification method identified social integration, domestic safety, financial resources, food insecurity, transportation, housing, and stress in proportions ranging from 5% to 36%. The passive method contributed to the identification of financial resource issues and stress, identifying 9.6% and 3% of patients to be experiencing these issues, respectively.

Common clinical tools and machine-learning (ML) models for screening osteoporosis have been developed, but they show limitations such as low accuracy. Moreover, these methods are confined to limited risk factors and lack individualized explanation. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable deep-learning (DL) model for osteoporosis risk screening with clinical features. Clinical interpretation with individual explanations of feature contributions is provided using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. Methods: We used two separate data sets: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data sets from the United States (NHANES) and South Korea (KNHANES) with 8274 and 8680 respondents, respectively. The study population was classified according to the T-score of bone mineral density at the femoral neck or total femur. A DL model for osteoporosis diagnosis was trained on the data sets and significant risk factors were investigated with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The performance of the DL model was compared with that of ML models and conventional clinical tools. Additionally, contribution ranking of risk factors and individualized explanation of feature contribution were examined. Results: Our DL model showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.851 (95% CI 0.844-0.858) and 0.922 (95% CI 0.916-0.928) for the femoral neck and total femur bone mineral density, respectively, using the NHANES data set. The corresponding AUC values for the KNHANES data set were 0.827 (95% CI 0.821-0.833) and 0.912 (95% CI 0.898-0.927), respectively. Through the LIME method, significant features were induced, and each feature’s integrated contribution and interpretation for individual risk were determined. Conclusions: The developed DL model significantly outperforms conventional ML models and clinical tools. Our XAI model produces high-ranked features along with the integrated contributions of each feature, which facilitates the interpretation of individual risk. In summary, our interpretable model for osteoporosis risk screening outperformed state-of-the-art methods. ©Bogyeong Suh, Heejin Yu, Hyeyeon Kim, Sanghwa Lee, Sunghye Kong, Jin-Woo Kim, Jongeun Choi.","artificial intelligence; deep learning; machine learning; osteoporosis; risk factors; screening","calcium oxide; artificial intelligence; human; nutrition; osteoporosis; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Osteoporosis"

This type of estimation is highly significant because there is always a challenge existing for online, continuous, and accurate monitoring despite the complexities involved in the measurement since air heating systems find a wide range of applications in various process industries such as the ore drying industry, food processing industry, and pharmaceutical industry and are of great importance for developing an indigenous scheme. To alleviate this difficulty, various artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning neural networks (DNN), fuzzy logic (FL), and hybrid deep learning neuro-fuzzy logic (HDNFL) have been newly deployed for robust estimation of industrial parameters. The major drawback with fuzzy logic is the assignment of membership functions (MFs). The other challenges include the choice of the optimal architecture for the conventional ANN trained with deep learning algorithms. Consequently, an innovative scheme combining the DNN and FL is presented and proposed in this chapter for the estimation of industrial parameters. This technique, which is based on DNN and FL, is called the “hybrid deep learning neuro-fuzzy logic” (HDNFL), which cascades the two methods, namely, the DNN and FL. A couple of artificial intelligence techniques are incorporated to build this kind of intelligent system for monitoring the industrial process parameters. To improvise the performance of the proposed industrial system, a unique algorithm HDNFL is developed for the first time to eliminate the complexity involved in optimization of process parameters for an air heating system. Hence, for this purpose, a network with optimal parameters is used to train the DNN, which includes learning factor, momentum, and choice of the activation function. The finalized DNN architecture will facilitate the tuning of the MFs corresponding to each input in the fuzzy logic scheme. A comparison of these techniques (DNN, fuzzy logic) with the proposed innovative method, “HDNFL,” is also carried out for the air heating system which is one of the important systems in many industries. MATLAB is used for result analysis and inference of the output temperature. The results depict that “HDNFL” is capable of estimating the industrial parameters with utmost accuracy and is therefore suggested to be suitable for monitoring industrial parameters. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

First, Gaussian filters Sobel smooth de-noising Laplace operator (GSSL) was employed to reduce image noise and enhance the texture of grape leaves. A novel network designated coordinated attention shuffle mechanism-asymmetric multi-scale fusion module net (CASM-AMFMNet) was subsequently applied for grape leaf disease identification.

The experimental results based on our self-made grape leaf image dataset showed that, compared to existing methods, CASM-AMFMNet achieved an accuracy of 95.95%, F1 score of 95.78%, and mAP of 90.27%. Overall, the model and methods proposed in this report could successfully identify different diseases of grape leaves and provide a feasible scheme for deep learning to correctly recognize grape diseases during agricultural production that may be used as a reference for other crops diseases.

The primary cause of these problems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits, which are manageable using interactive mHealth apps. However, traditional dietary monitoring systems using manual food logging suffer from imprecision, underreporting, time consumption, and low adherence. Recent dietary monitoring systems tackle these challenges by automatic assessment of dietary intake through machine learning methods. This survey discusses the best-performing methodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food recognition and volume estimation. Firstly, the paper presented the rationale of visual-based methods for food recognition. Then, the core of the study is the presentation, discussion, and evaluation of these methods based on popular food image databases. In this context, this study discusses the mobile applications that are implementing these methods for automatic food logging. Our findings indicate that around 66.7% of surveyed studies use visual features from deep neural networks for food recognition. Similarly, all surveyed studies employed a variant of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for ingredient recognition due to recent research interest. Finally, this survey ends with a discussion of potential applications of food image analysis, existing research gaps, and open issues of this research area. Learning from unlabeled image datasets in an unsupervised manner, catastrophic forgetting during continual learning, and improving model transparency using explainable AI are potential areas of interest for future studies. © 2021 by the authors.

This feature contributes to the management of various chronic conditions. Challenges such as inter and intraclass variations alongside the practical applications of smart glasses, wearable cameras, and mobile devices require resource-efficient food recognition models with high classification performance. Furthermore, explainable AI is also crucial in health-related domains as it characterizes model performance, enhancing its transparency and objectivity. Our proposed architecture attempts to address these challenges by drawing on the strengths of the transfer learning technique upon initializing MobiletNetV3 with weights from a pre-trained model of ImageNet. The MobileNetV3 achieves superior performance using the squeeze and excitation strategy, providing unequal weight to different input channels and contrasting equal weights in other variants. Despite being fast and efficient, there is a high possibility for it to be stuck in the local optima like other deep neural networks, reducing the desired classification performance of the model. Thus, we overcome this issue by applying the snapshot ensemble approach as it enables the M model in a single training process without any increase in the required training time. As a result, each snapshot in the ensemble visits different local minima before converging to the final solution which enhances recognition performance. On overcoming the challenge of explainability, we argue that explanations cannot be monolithic, since each stakeholder perceive the results’, explanations based on different objectives and aims. Thus, we proposed a user-centered explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework to increase the trust of the involved parties by inferencing and rationalizing the results according to needs and user profile. Our framework is comprehensive in terms of a dietary assessment app as it detects Food/Non-Food, food categories, and ingredients.

At the field level, NO3 leaching is highly variable due to interactions among soil, weather and crop management factors, but the relative effects of these drivers have not been quantified on a global scale. Using a global database of 82 field studies in temperate rainfed cereal crops with 961 observations, our objectives were to (a) quantify the relative importance of environmental and management variables to identify key leverage points for NO3 mitigation and (b) determine associated changes in crop productivity and potential tradeoffs for high and low NO3 loss scenarios. Machine learning algorithms (XGboost) and feature importance analysis showed that the amount and intensity of rainfall explained the most variability in NO3 leaching (up to 24 kg N ha-1), followed by nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate and crop N removal. In contrast, other soil and management variables such as soil texture, crop type, tillage and N source, timing and placement had less importance. To reduce N losses from global agriculture under changing weather and climatic conditions, these results highlight the need for better targeting and increased adoption of science-based, locally adapted management practices for improving N use efficiency. Future policy discussions should support this transition through different instruments while also promoting more advanced weather prediction analytics, especially in areas susceptible to extreme climatic variation. © 2022 The Author(s).

But could the cure be worse than the disease? Understanding low probability, yet plausible, high-impact cases is critical to prudent climate risk management and SAI deliberation. But analyses of such high impact outcomes are lacking in SAI research. This paper helps resolve this gap by investigating SAI's contributions to global catastrophic risk. We split SAI's contributions to catastrophic risk into four interrelated dimensions: 1. Acting as a direct catastrophic risk through potentially unforeseen ecological blowback. 2. Interacting with other globally catastrophic hazards like nuclear war. 3. Exacerbating systemic risk (risks that cascade and amplify across different systems); 4. Acting as a latent risk (risk that is dormant but can later be triggered). The potential for major unforeseen environmental consequences seems highly unlikely but is ultimately unknown. SAI plausibly interacts with other catastrophic calamities, most notably by potentially exacerbating the impacts of nuclear war or an extreme space weather event. SAI could contribute to systemic risk by introducing stressors into critical systems such as agriculture. SAI's systemic stressors, and risks of systemic cascades and synchronous failures, are highly understudied. SAI deployment more tightly couples different ecological, economic, and political systems. This creates a precarious condition of latent risk, the largest cause for concern. Thicker SAI masking extreme warming could create a planetary Sword of Damocles. That is, if SAI were removed but underlying greenhouse gas concentrations not reduced, there would be extreme warming in a very short timeframe. Sufficiently large global shocks could force SAI termination and trigger SAI's latent risk, compounding disasters and catastrophic risks. Across all these dimensions, the specific SAI deployment, and associated governance, is critical. A well-coordinated use of a small amount of SAI would incur negligible risks, but this is an optimistic scenario. Conversely, larger use of SAI used in an uncoordinated manner poses many potential dangers. We cannot equivocally determine whether SAI will be worse than warming. For now, a heavy reliance on SAI seems an imprudent policy response.

Automatic classification of plant disease using deep learning methods helps to analyze the food quality and productivity. The existing methods applied Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models such as VGG-19, VGG-16, AlexNet, and Resnet-50 for plant disease classification. The existing methods have limitations of vanishing gradient problem and overfitting problem in plant disease classification. The ResNext50-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to improve plant disease classification performance. The hybrid of ResNext50-LSTM model is proposed for effective feature extraction from input images and classification of plant diseases. The ResNext50 architectures helps to limit increases of features in input layer to eliminate bottleneck problem and store relevant features for long term in LSTM for classification. The ResNext 50 model increases the features from 4 to 128 for optimal path construction and existing techniques increases the features more than 128 that causes the overfitting problem. This process of feature limit helps to reduce the overfitting problem and vanishing gradient in LSTM model. The ResNext50 is applied to extract and select the relevant features from input images and LSTM model has advantage of store the relevant information on long term for classification. The ResNext50 model selects the features to differentiate the correlation between the relevant and irrelevant features in feature extraction.

Many factors can cause a person to get affected by diabetes, like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, family history, physical inactivity, bad food habit etc. Increased urination is one of the most common symptoms of this disease. People with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been developed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and collected additional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in Bangladesh. Feature selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in this work. A semi-supervised model with extreme gradient boosting has been utilized to predict the insulin features of the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN approaches have been employed to manage the class imbalance problem. The authors used machine learning classification methods, that is, decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensemble techniques, to determine which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system.

Recent years have seen a rapid growth of AI in many disciplines. This review will focus on AI applications in the assessment of thyroid nodules. Summary: AI encompasses two related computational techniques: machine learning, in which computers learn by observing data provided by humans, and deep learning, which employs neural networks that mimic brain structure and function to analyze data. Some experts believe the way AI systems reach a conclusion should be transparent, or explainable, while others disagree. Most AI platforms in thyroid disease have focused on malignancy risk stratification of nodules. To date, four have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. While the results of validation studies have been mixed, there is ample evidence that AI can exceed the performance of some humans, particularly physicians with less experience. AI has also been applied to assessment of lymph nodes and cytopathology specimens. Conclusions: Adoption of AI in thyroid disease will require vendors to demonstrate that their software works as intended, is readily usable in real-world settings, and is cost effective.

In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based leaf disease detection model, namely FormerLeaf along with two optimization methods to enhance the model performance. In more detail, we propose the Least Important Attention Pruning (LeIAP) algorithm to select the most important attention heads of each layer in the Transformer model. It could reduce the model size up to 28% and accelerate the evaluation speed by 15% with about 3% accuracy enhancement.

This leads to significant crop loss in different parts of the world. To provide effective solutions, several smart agriculture solutions are deployed for the control of pests and plant diseases using vision-based machine learning techniques. Despite rapid growth in the field, not many methods have been explored for their suitability in real-time applications. Several open challenges need to be addressed for the applicability of machine learning techniques in IoT-based smart agriculture solutions. Starting from data capturing methods and the availability of public datasets, the present paper provides a comprehensive review of vision-based machine learning techniques for plant disease detection. Initially, 1337 articles were selected from various scholarly resources to perform the survey. Based on the saliency of approaches, 148 articles are reviewed in this paper. Interestingly, a significant amount of research in this direction is taken up by Chinese and Indian researchers, and deep learning is the current research trend, as in other fields. The review concludes that a majority of existing methods exhibit their efficacy on public datasets captured mostly in controlled environmental conditions, but their generalization capability for in-field plant disease detection has not been explored. Lightweight CNN-based methods, on the other hand, have been designed for a limited number of diseases only, and are generally trained on small datasets.

The sensory qualities and flavor profiles of fermented pork loin hams from 0 to 42 days were investigated in order to reveal the dynamics of fermented pork loin ham. The results show that total free amino acids (TFAA) content reached the highest value on the 35th day, and the umami amino acids, including aspartic acid (ASP), glutamic acid (GLU), glycine (GLY), and alanine (ALA), were the main amino acids in all periods. Notably, the RV coefficient (0.875) indicates that free amino acids (FAA) are highly correlated with the sensory score of the E-tongue. In terms of the volatile compounds identified, the esters content gradually increased between 7 and 42 days, and ethyl octanoate was the most abundant compound during all periods. These esters imparted a characteristic aroma component to the fermented pork loin ham. The most important finding was that the increase in the content of esters represented by octanoic acid-ethyl ester might be related to the increase in the content of FAA with the increase in fermentation time. Both the E-nose and E-tongue showed good discrimination ability for fermented tenderloin ham with different fermentation times, which was crucial in cases with large clusters. In addition, the multiple factor analysis (MFA) indicated that the E-nose aroma value might be the key factor in distinguishing fermented pork loin ham with different fermentation times. © 2022 by the authors.

These are limiting their development and productivity and are subsequently threatening our food security, especially when considering the pressure of the increasing global population. Thus, there is an urgent need for the next generation of crops with high productivity and resilience to climate change. The dawn of a new era characterized by the emergence of fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies has redefined the ideological boundaries of research and applications in plant sciences. Recent technological advances and machine learning (ML)-based computational tools and omics data analysis approaches are allowing scientists to derive comprehensive metabolic descriptions and models for the target plant species under specific conditions. Such accurate metabolic descriptions are imperatively essential for devising a roadmap for the next generation of crops that are resilient to environmental deterioration. By synthesizing the recent literature and collating data on metabolomics studies on plant responses to abiotic stresses, in the context of the 4IR era, we point out the opportunities and challenges offered by omics science, analytical intelligence, computational tools and big data analytics. Specifically, we highlight technological advancements in (plant) metabolomics workflows and the use of machine learning and computational tools to decipher the dynamics in the chemical space that define plant responses to abiotic stress conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Such abundance of data enables machine learning-based soil moisture forecast as an alternative to traditional mechanistic approaches for irrigation water need estimation. This paper develops a guideline for soil moisture forecast modeling based on machine learning, tested in a real case analysis comprehending eight crop types in twelve fields from four farms distributed over diverse climatic scenarios in Brazil. Instead of a single value, we predict the following days' minimum and maximum values as targets to monitor risks of extreme soil moisture values. Furthermore, modeling soil moisture directly in volumetric water content (VWC) is better than modeling soil matric potential (SMP) to later convert in soil moisture VWC. We test several algorithms and find out that LightGBM outperforms linear regression, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, LSTM, and StemGNN. Also, blending predictions via algorithm ensemble provides an additional accuracy gain. For model training and accuracy measurement, we use weighted datasets to privilege rare but critical data points. We show that soil moisture forecast reaches its maximum performance considering only past soil moisture, a context-aware index, and a precipitation forecast. Finally, we demonstrate that traditional domain-knowledge features - such as evapotranspiration, crop phenology, and soil hydraulic behavior - are not relevant to improving SM forecast performance.

This paper has two main goals: (i) use data fusion to improve yield prediction in aeroponics, and (ii) find which features are more relevant for yield prediction of six different crops. To reach these goals, a number of artificial intelligence models and an interpretability analysis based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have been implemented. The models were trained using 200 samples that were collected in a nine-month period, including information from different air and water quality sensors in addition to manually recorded data, reaching in the end a coefficient of determination value R2 = 0.752 for the validation dataset in the best case (CNN-based model). As a result, two main features were identified in the dataset: Room CO2 and Reservoir Temperature, along with other useful insights of how these features influence predictions. SHAP values also provided important information for feature selection.

This study assesses key components of previous fish recruitment models by exploring spatiotemporal variation in larval fish assemblages in response to predicted key drivers in a tropical Australian river catchment. Data on larval fish composition and abundance, alongside hydrological, hydraulic, habitat and food variables, were collected monthly to bimonthly over one year at eight sites. Variables which best predicted larval fish abundance and diversity were determined with Boosted Regression Trees. The most commonly important predictors were microfauna abundance, structural habitat complexity and temperature, with high values of each predicting high larval fish abundance and diversity. Maximum larval diversity occurred when discharge was highest because several wet-season spawning taxa occurred alongside aseasonally spawning taxa. These findings support previous generic fish recruitment models, demonstrating the utility of their inclusion in the recent Riverine Recruitment Synthesis Model and the applicability of this model for describing processes important for tropical riverine fish recruitment. © 2022 Author(s) Tyler, Wedd, Crook and Kennard and La Trobe University.","Daly River; habitat complexity; hydrology; northern Australia; zooplankton","abundance; complexity; discharge; fish; hydrology; identification method; recruitment (population dynamics); regression analysis; spawning; species diversity; wet season; zooplankton; Australia; Daly River; Northern Territory"

More importantly, the community should accept such solutions to be able realistically to apply them. In our collaborative computational framework for decision support, machines and humans interact to converge on the best solutions accepted by the community. In this framework, trust among human actors during decision making is measured and managed using a novel trust management framework. Furthermore, such trust is used to encourage human actors, depending on their trust sensitivity, to choose among the solutions generated by algorithms that satisfy the community's preferred trade-offs among various objectives.

This is notably the case of applications related to art since the appreciation and the comprehension of art is considered to be an exclusively human capacity. This paper discusses the potential human-AI synergies aiming at explaining the history of art and artistic style transfer.

The latter is a satellite event of Esch2022 European Capital of Culture whose main aim is to reflect on AI and the future of art. The project is mainly an outreach and knowledge dissemination project, it uses a smart photo-booth, capable of automatically transforming the user’s picture into a well-known artistic style (e.g., impressionism), as an interactive approach to introduce the principles of the history of art to the open public and provide them with a simple explanation of different art painting styles. Whereas some of the cutting-edge AI algorithms can provide insights on what constitutes an artistic style on the visual level, the information provided by human experts is essential to explain the historical and political context in which the style emerged. To bridge this gap, this paper explores Human-AI synergies in which the explanation generated by the eXplainable AI (XAI) mechanism is coupled with insights from the human expert to provide explanations for school students as well as a wider audience.

In this study, machine learning (ML) technologies are adopted to enable automated composting by predicting compost maturity and providing process regulation. Four machine learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) are employed to predict the seed germination index (GI) and C/N ratio. Based on the best fusion model with the highest R2 of 0.977 and 0.986 for the multi-task prediction of GI and C/N ratio, the critical factors and their interactions with maturity are identified. Moreover, the ML model is validated on a composting reactor and the ML-based prediction application can provide regulation to ensure food waste decompose within the required time.

It is useful to timely collect the AGB data to monitor wheat growth and to build high-yielding wheat groups. However, as traditional AGB data acquisition relies on destructive sampling, it is difficult to adapt to the modernization of agriculture, and the estimation accuracy of spectral data alone is low and cannot solve the problem of index saturation at later stages. In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an RGB camera and the real-time kinematic (RTK) was used to obtain imagery data and elevation data at the same time during the critical fertility period of wheat. The cumulative percentile and the mean value methods were then used to extract the wheat plant height (PH), and the color indices (CIS) and PH were combined to invert the AGB of wheat using parametric and non-parametric models. The results showed that the accuracy of the model improved with the addition of elevation data, and the model with the highest accuracy of multi-fertility period estimation was PLSR (PH + CIS), with R2, RMSE and NRMSE of 0.81, 1248.48 kg/ha and 21.77%, respectively. Compared to the parametric models, the non-parametric models incorporating PH and CIS greatly improved the prediction of AGB during critical fertility periods in wheat. The inclusion of elevation data therefore greatly improves the accuracy of AGB prediction in wheat compared to traditional spectral prediction models. The fusion of UAV-based elevation data and image information provides a new technical tool for multi-season wheat AGB monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.","AGB; color indices; elevation; regression models; UAV RGB image; wheat",

Here, one strain of Acinetobacter venetianus with ester synthase-production capacity, SCSMX-3, was isolated from traditional fermented golden pomfret. It exhibited good growth in mesophilic, low salt, and slightly alkaline environments. The ester synthase produced by SCSMX-3 displayed maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 35 °C. Genome sequencing revealed that the strain contains one circular chromosome of 336313 bp and two circular plasmids (plasmid A-14424 bp and plasmid B-11249 bp). Six CRISPR structures enhance the genomic stability of SCSMX-3 and provide the opportunity to create new functional strains.

Little is known about the longitudinal association of gut microbiota with glycaemic control. We aimed to identify gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and examined the cross-sectional association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the identified gut microbiota. Methods: The China Health and Nutrition Survey is a population-based longitudinal cohort covering 15 provinces/megacities across China. Of the participants in that study, 2772 diabetes-free participants with a gut microbiota profile based on 16S rRNA analysis were included in the present study (age 50.8 ± 12.7 years, mean ± SD). Using a multivariable-adjusted linear mixed-effects model, we examined the prospective association of gut microbiota with glycaemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR). We constructed a healthy microbiome index (HMI), and used Poisson regression to examine the relationship between the HMI and incident type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the association of dietary or lifestyle factors with the glycaemic trait-related gut microbiota using a multivariable-adjusted linear regression model. Results: After follow-up for 3 years, 123 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified. We identified 25 gut microbial genera positively or inversely associated with glycaemic traits. The newly created HMI (per SD unit) was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes (risk ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58, 0.84). Furthermore, we found that several microbial genera that were favourable for the glycaemic trait were consistently associated with healthy dietary habits (higher consumption of vegetable, fruit, fish and nuts). Conclusions/interpretation: Our results revealed multiple gut microbiota prospectively associated with glycaemic traits and type 2 diabetes in a geographically diverse population, and highlighted the potential of gut microbiota-based diagnosis or therapy for type 2 diabetes.

The pathway memberships of most plant enzyme genes are unknown. While co-expression is useful for assigning genes to pathways, expression correlation may exist only under specific spatiotemporal and conditional contexts. Utilising > 600 tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) expression data combinations, three strategies for predicting memberships in 85 pathways were explored. Optimal predictions for different pathways require distinct data combinations indicative of pathway functions. Naive prediction (i.e. identifying pathways with the most similarly expressed genes) is error prone. In 52 pathways, unsupervised learning performed better than supervised approaches, possibly due to limited training data availability. Using gene-to-pathway expression similarities led to prediction models that outperformed those based simply on expression levels. Using 36 experimental validated genes, the pathway-best model prediction accuracy is 58.3%, significantly better compared with that for predicting annotated genes without experimental evidence (37.0%) or random guess (1.2%), demonstrating the importance of data quality.

However, microbial functioning, as well as temporal differences and mechanisms causing microbial community shifts, remains comparably little explored. Here, using Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system containing a low microbial diversity, we studied temporal changes in microbial community structure and functioning. For that, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the composition of bacteria and fungi and analyzed the microbially derived metabolome throughout the fermentation process in all four seasons in both 2018 and 2019. We show that microbial communities and the metabolome changed throughout the fermentation process in each of the four seasons, with metabolome diversity increasing throughout the fermentation process. Across seasons, bacterial and fungal communities as well as the metabolome driven by 10 indicator microorganisms and six metabolites varied even more. Daily average temperature in the external surroundings was the primary determinant of the observed temporal microbial community and metabolome changes. Collectively, our work reveals critical insights into patterns and processes determining temporal changes of microbial community composition and functioning. We highlight the importance of linking taxonomic to functional changes in microbial ecology to enable predictions of human-relevant applications. IMPORTANCE We used Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system to show that microbiome composition changes more dramatically across seasons than throughout the fermentation process within seasons. These changes translate to differences in the metabolome as the ultimate functional outcome of microbial activity, suggesting that temporal changes in microbiome composition are translating into functional changes. This result is striking as it suggests that microbial functioning, despite controlled conditions in the fermentors, fluctuates over season along with external temperature differences, which threatens a reproducible food taste. As such, we believe that our study provides a stepping-stone into novel taxonomy-functional studies that promote future work in other systems and that also is relevant in applied settings to better control surrounding conditions in food production.

The response of water quality to landscape composition and configuration has been extensively studied, but landscape intensity has been disregarded. Therefore, constructing a comprehensive impact factor indicator and determining the pivotal factors are essential. This study focused on the response relationship of landscape composition, configuration, and intensity metrics to water quality. Water quality index included total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from 43 monthly sites in the main rivers of the Taihu Lake Basin (TLB) in 2017. The TN:TP index was calculated. We used the partial least squares regression (PLS) method to explore the response strength between each index at different temporal and spatial scales, and the coefficient of determination (R2) calculated based on PLS was 0.4677 to 0.9039, in which the simulation effect was acceptable. In terms of pivotal influenced factors, industrial and domestic effluents for TN and TP showed a major effect in crop (CDR) and forest dominated region (FDR). For the TN:TP index, the pivotal influencing factors was merely industrial waste water discharge. In the fitting based on the pivotal factors of polynomial regression (PR), the landscape threshold of industrial and domestic effluents intensities to TN in CDR were higher than FDR, and landscape threshold substantially exceeded the water quality standard lines in CDR. This research can provide a reference for water quality precision management, distribution of pollutant emissions, and regional sustainable planning from the perspective of landscape regulation in TLB. © 2022","Landscape intensity; Landscape pattern; Landscape threshold; Water quality","Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Effluents; Least squares approximations; Quality management; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Landscape composition; Landscape intensity; Landscape pattern; Landscape thresholds; Nitrogen phosphorus; Partial least square regression; Phosphorus indices; Taihu Lake basin; Total nitrogen; Total phosphorus; Water quality; industrial waste; landscape; pollutant; precision; water quality; China; Taihu; Taihu Basin; Taihu Lake"

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from genetic (G), environmental (E), and management (M) conditions is a long-standing challenge with implications to agriculture, medicine, and conservation. Most methods reduce the factors in a dataset (feature engineering) in a subjective and potentially oversimplified manner. Deep neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MPL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can overcome this by allowing the data itself to determine which factors are most important. CNN models were developed for predicting agronomic yield from a combination of replicated trials and historical yield survey data. The results were more accurate than standard methods when tested on held-out G, E, and M data (r = 0.50 vs. r = 0.43), and performed slightly worse than standard methods when only G was held out (r = 0.74 vs. r = 0.80). Pre-training on historical data increased accuracy compared to trial data alone.

While mechanisms and impacts of climatic stressors (e.g. frost, drought, heat or flooding) have been studied individually, little is known their combined impacts on crops to be expected under actual production conditions. This lack of process knowledge is reflected in the few instances of crop models considering multiple stressors. Here we provide an overview of the representation of single stressors in process based crop models. From this basis, a framework to consider multiple stressors in current models is presented, defining four stressor combination types: 1. Single exposure; 2. No direct interaction; 3. Known interaction; and 4. Unknown interaction. An analytical framework from ecological sciences is then presented as an approach to consider when formulating algorithms for the 4th type of unknown interactions.

This variation has recently been shown to have important implications when training machine learning models on geotagged image datasets for specific object detection and classification tasks. For example, models trained on datasets with ethnocentric biases in image content have been shown to misclassify objects in under-sampled regions, particularly in least-developed countries. The need to evaluate the growing corpus of RSI datasets for representativeness, heterogeneity and geodiversity is therefore high; yet scalable methods for measuring these concepts are absent in the remote sensing domain. This paper introduces the first dataset analysis methods for detecting and assessing geodiversity problems in large RSI datasets, based on geospatial adaptations of the Fréchet Inception Distance and Inception Score in the deep learning framework. Geospatial Fréchet Distance is proposed as a dissimilarity measure for image features of an object class across geographic regions - useful for comparing differences in object class appearance in different locations and/or spatial scales. A complementary Geospatial Inception Score is proposed to quantify heterogeneity of geographic context present in dataset labels within particular regions/locations, taking into account the labels themselves as well as their immediate surroundings. Rigorous tests of these methods on simulated RSI datasets demonstrate their stability, sensitivity, and the broad range of dataset analyses to which they can be applied. © 2013 IEEE.","Big geodata; Deep convolutional neural networks; Explainable ai; Geographic domain shift; GIS-remote sensing fusion; Imagery interpretation; Spatial data analysis","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Learning systems; Object detection; Remote sensing; Scalability; Statistical tests; Classification tasks; Dissimilarity measures; Geographic contexts; Geographic variation; Learning frameworks; Least-developed countries; Remotely sensed imagery; Training machines; Large dataset"

However, the models used for this approach tend to become black-box models, in the sense that it is difficult to trace characters that are the base for the classification. The interpretability is therefore limited and the explanatory factors may not be based on reasonable visible characters. We investigate the explanatory factors of recent machine learning and deep learning models for plant classification tasks. Based on a Daucus carota and a Beta vulgaris image data set, we implement plant classification models and compare those models by their predictive performance as well as explainability. For comparison we implemented a feed forward convolutional neuronal network as a default model. To evaluate the performance, we trained an unsupervised Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable model as well as a convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction and rely on a support vector machine for classification. The explanatory factors of all models were extracted and analyzed. The experiments show, that feed forward convolutional neuronal networks (98.24% and 96.10% mean accuracy) outperforms the Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable pipeline (92.08% and 94.31% mean accuracy) as well as the convolutional autoenceoder pipeline (92.38% and 93.28% mean accuracy) based approaches in terms of classification accuracy, even though not significant for Beta vulgaris images. Additionally, we found that the neuronal network used biological uninterpretable image regions for the plant classification task. In contrast to that, the unsupervised learning models rely on explainable visual characters. We conclude that supervised convolutional neuronal networks must be used carefully to ensure biological interpretability. We recommend unsupervised machine learning, careful feature investigation, and statistical feature analysis for biological applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently launched science-driven missions, such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), deliver unprecedented data from the Earth's surface. This new kind of data should be explored to develop robust retrieval schemes for deriving crucial variables from future routine missions. Therefore, we present a workflow for inferring crop carbon content (Carea), and aboveground dry and wet biomass (AGBdry, AGBfresh) from EnMAP data. To achieve this, a hybrid workflow was generated, combining radiative transfer modeling (RTM) with machine learning regression algorithms. The key concept involves: (1) coupling the RTMs PROSPECT-PRO and 4SAIL for simulation of a wide range of vegetation states, (2) using dimensionality reduction to deal with collinearity, (3) applying a semi-supervised active learning technique against a 4-years campaign dataset, followed by (4) training of a Gaussian process regression (GPR) machine learning algorithm and (5) validation with an independent in situ dataset acquired during the ESA Hypersense experiment campaign at a German test site. Internal validation of the GPR-Careaand GPR-AGB models achieved coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.80 for Carea and 0.80, 0.71 for AGBdry and AGBfresh, respectively. The mapping capability of these models was successfully demonstrated using airborne AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imagery, which was spectrally resampled to EnMAP spectral properties. Plausible estimates were achieved over both bare and green fields after adding bare soil spectra to the training data. Validation over green winter wheat fields generated reliable estimates as suggested by low associated model uncertainties (&lt; 40%). These results suggest a high degree of model reliability for cultivated areas during active growth phases at canopy closure. Overall, our proposed carbon and biomass models based on EnMAP spectral sampling demonstrate a promising path toward the inference of these crucial variables over cultivated areas from future spaceborne operational hyperspectral missions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Active learning; AVIRIS-NG; Biomass; Carbon content; EnMAP; Gaussian process regression","Bayesian networks; Carbon; Crops; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; NASA; Photomapping; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Active Learning; AVIRIS-NG; Carbon content; Environmental analysis; Environmental mapping; Environmental mapping and analyse program; Gaussian process regression; Hyper-spectral imageries; Space-borne; Work-flows; Biomass; agricultural management; algorithm; bare soil; biomass; estimation method; experimental study; Gaussian method; model validation; training"

Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, these population-based approaches have yet to be translated to the individual. As well as using biological age as a research tool, by being able to better answer the question “why did we get this result?"", clinicians may be able to apply personalised interventions that could improve the long-term health of individual patients. Methods: Here, the boosted decision tree algorithm XGBoost was used to predict biological age using 39 commonly-available blood test results from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Results: Interrogation of the algorithm produced a description of how each marker contributed to the final output in a single individual. Additive explanation plots were then used to determine biomarker ranges associated with a lower biological age. Importantly, a number of markers that are modifiable with lifestyle changes were found to have a significant effect on biological age, including fasting blood glucose, lipids, and markers of red blood cell production. Conclusions: The combination of individualised outputs with target ranges could provide the ability to personalise interventions or recommendations based on an individual’s biochemistry and resulting predicted age. This would allow for the investigation of interventions designed to improve health and longevity in a targeted manner, many of which could be rooted in targeted lifestyle modifications. © 2019 Wood T et al.","Age; Aging; Machine Learning","biological marker; glucose; lipid; adult; age; aged; algorithm; Article; biological age; controlled study; decision tree; descriptive research; erythrocyte; female; glucose blood level; human; lifestyle modification; lipid blood level; machine learning; male; peer review; prediction; urea nitrogen blood level"

Accurate simulation of paddy field water temperature is important for studying its impact on crops and providing timely information to aid in decision-making for more efficient management under limited resources. We propose a neural-network framework that considers the heat transfer by the vegetation canopy and applies physical-theory constraints in its training. A novel tuning method is proposed to cope with the trade-off between water temperature accuracy and physical consistency during training to ensure that the calculated water temperature variations in a paddy field enjoy high accuracy and physical consistency. In the experiments, the proposed framework outperforms physical process models and pure neural network models while maintaining high accuracy in the case of sparse data sets. Furthermore, an attention-mechanism input layer is integrated into the model to rank feature importance, providing global interpretation to the proposed framework. We also perform sensitivity analysis on the physical process and propose models to compare their different strategies of feature ranking. The results show that the two methods have different sensitivities to different feature patterns, but they complement each other. In summary, the proposed model is credible and stable for practical applications and has the potential to guide more efficient paddy management. © 2022. American Geophysical Union.

Accurate and timely estimation of the sugarcane yield before harvest plays a particularly important role in the management of agroecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing technologies, especially Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), significantly enhances aboveground fresh weight (AFW) estimations. In our study, we evaluated the capability of LiDAR mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in estimating the sugarcane AFW in Fusui county, Chongzuo city of Guangxi province, China. We measured the height and the fresh weight of sugarcane plants in 105 sampling plots, and eight variables were extracted from the field-based measurements. Six regression algorithms were used to build the sugarcane AFW model: multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple regression (SMR), generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrate that RFR (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.27 kg m−2) performs better than other models in terms of prediction accuracy. The final fitted sugarcane AFW distribution maps exhibited good agreement with the observed values (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.33 kg m−2). Canopy cover, the distance to the road, and tillage methods all have an impact on sugarcane AFW.

However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combined effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics, and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and are nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology, and artificial intelligence (mainly focused on machine and deep learning). We discuss how to implement iGEP, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population, and species) and micro (gene, metabolism, and network) scales. Finally, we provide perspectives on translating smart breeding into genetic gain through integrative breeding platforms and open-source breeding initiatives.

We compare two representations of the pesticide molecules: (i) a random walk feature vector listing counts of length-L walks on the molecular graph with each vertex- and edge-label sequence and (ii) the Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) structural key fingerprint (FP), a bit vector indicating the presence/absence of a list of pre-defined subgraph patterns in the molecular graph.

While many studies have estimated marginal land availability using various methods, only a few studies have considered the role of socioeconomic factors in affecting perceptions about the availability of marginal land. This study analyzes land-use survey data to examine the determinants of farmers' perceptions of marginal land availability on their farms. We find that farmers' perceptions are affected by a combination of unfavorable biophysical (e.g., soil water capacity, temperature variability, and slope) and socioeconomic factors, of which farm size appears to be significant. Interestingly, we identify different determinants of perceptions among farmers that claim to have marginal land and those that do not; the former are determined mainly by unfavorable biophysical factors, while the latter are mainly explained by small farm size. We further apply a prediction model that is trained by a machine learning algorithm to Midwestern states, and derive maps of marginal land likelihood and associated dominant influencing factors. The results suggest that marginal land is primarily under pastureland and grassland cover and in the Dakotas and Nebraska; there is also some marginal land under crop production in the Corn Belt.

There are mainly two ways to obtain LAI: ground station measurement and remote sensing satellite monitoring. Recently, reliable progress has been made in long-term automatic LAI observation using wireless sensor network (WSN) technology under certain conditions. We developed and designed an LAI measurement system (LAIS) based on a wireless sensor network to select and improve the appropriate algorithm according to the image collected by the sensor, to get a more realistic leaf area index. The corn LAI was continuously observed from May 30 to July 16, 2015. Research on hardware has been published, this paper focuses on improved system algorithm and data verification. By improving the finite length average algorithm, the data validation results are as follows: (1) The slope of the fitting line between LAIS measurement data and the real value is 0.944, and the root means square error (RMSE) is 0.264 (absolute error ~ 0–0.6), which has high consistency with the real value.

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives. © 2021 The Author(s)","Explainable AI; Human-centered AI; Interpretable ML; Smart learning; Sustainable AI",

Aiming at the problems with insufficient numbers of labeled samples, complex backgrounds of sample images, and difficult extraction of useful feature information, a novel algorithm is proposed in this study based on attention mechanisms and convolutional neural networks for cassava leaf recognition. Specifically, a combined data augmentation strategy for datasets is used to prevent single distribution of image datasets, and then the PDRNet (plant disease recognition network) combining channel attention mechanism and spatial attention mechanism is proposed. The algorithm is designed as follows. Firstly, an attention module embedded in the network layer is deployed to establish remote dependence on each feature layer, strengthen the key feature information, and suppress the interference feature information, such as background noise. Secondly, a stochastic depth learning strategy is formulated to accelerate the training and inference of the network. And finally, a transfer learning method is adopted to load the pretrained weights into the model proposed in this study, with the recognition accuracy of the model enhanced by means of detailed parameter adjustments and dynamic changes in the learning rate. A large number of comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a recognition accuracy of 99.56% on the cassava disease image dataset, reaching the state-of-the-art level among CNN-based methods in terms of accuracy. © 2022 Yuanbo Ye et al.",,"Behavioral research; Convolution; Large dataset; Learning systems; Network layers; Plants (botany); Stochastic systems; Attention mechanisms; Complex background; Convolutional neural network; Crop disease; Feature information; Image datasets; Model-based OPC; Network robustness; Recognition accuracy; Visual attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural networks; algorithm; Manihot; methodology; Algorithms; Manihot; Neural Networks, Computer; Recognition, Psychology; Research Design"

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI.

This belowground world is challenging to observe and quantify; however, there are unprecedented opportunities using current methodologies to bring roots, microbes, and soil into focus. These opportunities allow not only breeding for increased feedstock production but breeding for increased soil health and carbon sequestration as well.

However, its interpretability is a challenge for building trust and providing insights into the learned relationships. Herein, we systematically investigated how the factors influence nanoparticle uptake during seed priming by ZnO nanoparticles and its effects on seed germination. The properties of the nanoparticles, priming solution, and seeds were considered. Post hoc interpretation and model-based interpretation of machine learning were integrated into two ways to understand the mechanism of nanoparticle uptake during seed priming and its biological effects on seed germination. The results indicated that nanoparticle concentration and ionic strength influenced the shoot fresh weight mainly by controlling the nanoparticle uptake. The nanoparticle uptake had a significant slowdown when the nanoparticle concentration exceeded 50 mg L−1. Although other factors, such as zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter, had no obvious effects on nanoparticle uptake, their biological effects cannot be ignored.

China contributes nearly one-fifth of the total production alone with its decreasing arable land. Timely and accurate prediction of maize yield in China is critical for ensuring global food security. Previous studies primarily used either visible or near-infrared (NIR) based vegetation indices (VIs), or climate data, or both to predict crop yield. However, other satellite data from different spectral bands have been underutilized, which contain unique information on crop growth and yield. In addition, although a joint application of multi-source data significantly improves crop yield prediction, the combinations of input variables that could achieve the best results have not been well investigated. Here we integrated optical, fluorescence, thermal satellite, and environmental data to predict county-level maize yield across four agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in China using a regression-based method (LASSO), two machine learning (ML) methods (RF and XGBoost), and deep learning (DL) network (LSTM). The results showed that combining multi-source data explained more than 75% of yield variation. Satellite data at the silking stage contributed more information than other variables, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) had an almost equivalent performance with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) largely due to the low signal to noise ratio and coarse spatial resolution. The extremely high temperature and vapor pressure deficit during the reproductive period were the most important climate variables affecting maize production in China. Soil properties and management factors contained extra information on crop growth conditions that cannot be fully captured by satellite and climate data. We found that ML and DL approaches definitely outperformed regression-based methods, and ML had more computational efficiency and easier generalizations relative to DL. Our study is an important effort to combine multi-source remote sensed and environmental data for large-scale yield prediction. The proposed methodology provides a paradigm for other crop yield predictions and in other regions. © 2019 by the authors.","EVI; LST; LSTM; Machine learning; Maize; SIF; Yield prediction","Computational efficiency; Crops; Deep learning; Fluorescence; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Infrared devices; Long short-term memory; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Enhanced vegetation index; Low signal-to-noise ratio; LSTM; Machine learning approaches; Maize; Vapor pressure deficit; Yield prediction; Learning systems"

We investigate whether consumer-posted photos can serve as a leading indicator of restaurant survival above and beyond reviews, firm characteristics, competitive landscape, and macroconditions. We employ machine learning techniques to extract features from 755, 758 photos and 1, 121, 069 reviews posted on Yelp between 2004 and 2015 for 17, 719 U.S. restaurants. We also collect data on restaurant characteristics (e.g., cuisine type, price level) and competitive landscape as well as entry and exit (if applicable) time from each restaurant’s Yelp/Facebook page, own website, or Google search engine. Using a predictive XGBoost algorithm, we find that consumer-posted photos are strong predictors of restaurant survival. Interestingly, the informativeness of photos (e.g., the proportion of food photos) relates more to restaurant survival than do photographic attributes (e.g., composition, brightness). Additionally, photos carry more predictive power for independent, young or mid-aged, and medium-priced restaurants. Assuming that restaurant owners possess no knowledge about future photos and reviews, photos can predict restaurant survival for up to three years, whereas reviews are only predictive for one year. We further employ causal forests to facilitate the interpretation of our predictive results. Among photo content variables, the proportion of food photos has the largest positive association with restaurant survival, followed by proportions of outside and interior photos. Among others, the proportion of photos with helpful votes also positively relates to restaurant survival. © 2022 INFORMS.","analytic modeling; business survival; computer vision; image analysis; photos; restaurants; text mining; user-generated content; word of mouth; Yelp","Learning systems; Search engines; Analytic modeling; Business survival; Image-analysis; Leading indicators; Photo; Restaurant; Text-mining; User-generated; User-generated content; Yelp; Computer vision"

However, there are problems of underreporting or erroneous reporting in FDMRS, which significantly increase the cost of related epidemic investigations. To solve this problem, we designed a model to identify suspected outbreaks from the data generated by the FDMRS of CFSA. In this study, machine learning models were used to fit the data. The recall rate and F1-score were used as evaluation metrics to compare the classification performance of each model. Feature importance and pathogenic factors were identified and analyzed using tree-based and gradient boosting models. Three real foodborne disease outbreaks were then used to evaluate the best performing model. Furthermore, the SHapley Additive exPlanation value was used to identify the effect of features. Among all machine learning classification models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance, with the highest recall rate and F1-score of 0.9699 and 0.9582, respectively. In terms of model validation, the model provides a correct judgment of real outbreaks. In the feature importance analysis with the XGBoost model, the health status of the other people with the same exposure has the highest weight, reaching 0.65. The machine learning model built in this study exhibits high accuracy in recognizing foodborne disease outbreaks, thus reducing the manual burden for medical staff.

Recently, deep learning methods have been rapidly developed in computer vision. To cope with these issues, we propose a dual-branch collaborative learning network for crop disease identification, called DBCLNet. Concretely, we propose a dual-branch collaborative module using convolutional kernels of different scales to extract global and local features of images, which can effectively utilize both global and local features. Meanwhile, we embed a channel attention mechanism in each branch module to refine the global and local features. Whereafter, we cascade multiple dual-branch collaborative modules to design a feature cascade module, which further learns features at more abstract levels via the multi-layer cascade design strategy. Extensive experiments on the Plant Village dataset demonstrated the best classification performance of our DBCLNet method compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the identification of 38 categories of crop diseases. Besides, the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-score of our DBCLNet for the identification of 38 categories of crop diseases are 99.89%, 99.97%, 99.67%, and 99.79%, respectively. 811 Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Sun, Zhou, Xie, Zhao, Liang and Zhuang.","channel attention; crop disease identification; deep learning; feature cascade; two-branch collaborative",

Various linear and nonlinear chemometric methods have been developed for spectral analysis. The generalizability of previous chemometric methods is hindered by changing noise under various detection conditions and biological variabilities. Recently, deep learning approaches have been developed for spectral noise reduction, feature extraction, and calibration regression modeling. Scope and approach: This review discusses the current challenges of conventional chemometric methods and the emerging deep learning approach for spectral analysis. The current state-of-the-art techniques, including unsupervised feature extraction and noise reduction models and supervised multivariate regression approaches, have been addressed in this review. The research on exploring the learning mechanism of the ‘black box’ deep learning model is also discussed. This review focuses on the application of deep learning approaches on quality evaluation of food and agro-products, lessons from current studies, and future perspectives. Key findings and conclusions: The deep learning approach combined with spectroscopic sensing techniques has shown great potential for quality evaluation of food and agro-products. Current advances in deep learning-based qualitative analysis include variety identification, geographical origin detection, adulteration recognition, and bruise detection, whereas quantitative analysis includes multiple component content prediction for fruits, grains, and crops. The main advantage of deep learning approach is the decreasing the dependence on human domain knowledge by end-to-end analysis and the improved precision and generalizability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Generalizability; Interpretability; Model robustness; Quality evaluation; Spectral analysis","Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Infrared spectroscopy; Quality control; Regression analysis; Spectrum analysis; 'current; Agro-products; Chemometric method; Deep learning; Features extraction; Generalizability; Interpretability; Learning approach; Model robustness; Quality evaluation; Noise abatement"

We collect mobility traces from two thousand users for around two months. We extract 16 mobility features from these passively collected mobility traces and train an XGBoost model to predict users' hospital visits. We demonstrate that the designed mobility features can significantly improve prediction accuracy (p < 0.01, AUC = 0.79). We further analyze how these mobility features affect the prediction results and measure their importance by using Shapley additive explanation values. We discover that users with less mobility activity, less visit diversity, and few sports facilities, bountiful entertainment around their visited locations are more likely to visit hospitals. Moreover, we conduct predictions on the populations with different demographic features, which achieves meaningful and insightful results, i.e. maintaining a high mobility activity is crucial for older people's health, while fast food store more substantially affects younger people's health; visit patterns can indicate females' health, while the neighborhood environment is more indicative of males, etc. These results shed light on how to use and understand large scale mobility data in health monitoring and other health-related applications in practice. © 2021 ACM.","Health monitoring; human mobility; mobile computing","Forecasting; Health; Hospitals; Demographic data; Demographic features; Health monitoring; Mobility activities; Mobility pattern; Mobility traces; Neighborhood environment; Prediction accuracy; Population statistics"

These regulations require that growers apply nitrogen to meet, but not exceed, the annual N demand for crop and tree growth and nut production. To accurately predict seasonal nitrogen demand, therefore, growers need to estimate block-level almond yield early in the growing season so that timely N management decisions can be made. However, methods to predict almond yield are not currently available. To fill this gap, we have developed statistical models using the Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning approach, for early season yield projection and mid-season yield update over individual orchard blocks. We collected yield records of 185 orchards, dating back to 2005, from the major almond growers in the Central Valley of California. A large set of variables were extracted as predictors, including weather and orchard characteristics from remote sensing imagery. Our results showed that the predicted orchard-level yield agreed well with the independent yield records. For both the early season (March) and mid-season (June) predictions, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71, and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.6 were found on average. We also identified several key determinants of yield based on the modeling results. Almond yield increased dramatically with the orchard age until about 7 years old in general, and the higher long-term mean maximum temperature during April–June enhanced the yield in the southern orchards, while a larger amount of precipitation in March reduced the yield, especially in northern orchards. Remote sensing metrics such as annual maximum vegetation indices were also dominant variables for predicting the yield potential. While these results are promising, further refinement is needed; the availability of larger data sets and incorporation of additional variables and methodologies will be required for the model to be used as a fertilization decision support tool for growers. Our study has demonstrated the potential of automatic almond yield prediction to assist growers to manage N adaptively, comply with mandated requirements, and ensure industry sustainability. © 2019 Zhang, Jin, Chen and Brown.","Almond orchard; Central valley; Machine learning; Nitrogen management; Remote sensing; Yield prediction; Yield variation",

We built a dataset for strawberry leaves, flowers and fruits, and the experimental results showed that the model was able to effectively detect healthy strawberries and seven strawberry diseases under natural conditions, with an mAP of 92.18% and an average detection time of only 229 ms.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has shown great potential in cereal kernel identification, but its low spatial resolution leads to external feature infidelity and limits the analysis accuracy. In this study, the fusion of HSI and RGB images and improved ShuffleNet were combined to develop an identification method for soybean kernel damages. First, the HSI-RGB fusion network (HRFN) was designed based on super-resolution and spectral modification modules to process the registered HSI and RGB image pairs and generate super-resolution HSI (SR-HSI) images. ShuffleNet improved with convolution optimization and cross-stage partial architecture (ShuffleNet_COCSP) was used to build classification models with the optimal image set of effective wavelengths (OISEW) of SR-HSI images obtained by support vector machine and ShuffleNet. High-quality fusion of HSI and RGB with the obvious spatial promotion and satisfactory spectral conservation was gained by HRFN. ShuffleNet_COCSP and OISEW obtained the optimal recognition performance of ACCp=98.36%, Params=0.805 M, and FLOPs=0.097 G, outperforming other classification methods and other types of images. Overall, the proposed method provides an accurate and reliable identification of soybean kernel damages and would be extended to analysis of other quality indicators of various crop kernels.

Accurately screening and identifying frailty can promote better quality and personalized medical services for the elderly. Previous studies have shown that the association between vitamin D and frailty in the elderly population is still controversial. More research is needed to explore the association between them. Materials and methods: We used three waves of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Based on the widely accepted AAH FRAIL Scale, we measured and evaluated the participants’ frailty from five aspects: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss of weight. All possible relevant variables are included. Machine learning XGboost algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and univariate logistic regression were used to screen variables, and multivariate logistic regression and generalized additive model (GAM) were used to build the model. Finally, subgroup analysis and interaction test were performed to further confirm the association. Results: In our study, XGboost machine learning algorithm explored the relative importance of all included variables, which confirmed the close association between vitamin D and frailty. After adjusting for all significant covariates, the result indicated that for each additional unit of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the risk of frailty was reduced by 1.3% with a statisticaldifference. A smooth curve was constructed based on the GAM. It was found that there was a significant negative correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and the risk of frailty. Conclusion: There may be a negative correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and the risk of frailty. However, more well-designed studies are needed to verify this relationship.

Although urban expansion results in population agglomeration and dramatic changes of land use, it also brings municipal water infrastructures to enhance the water quality of urban water bodies. In order to understand the relationship between water quality and urban expansion and water environmental management, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured, which were taken from 68 small urban water bodies in three distance bands (<5 km, 5–10 km and >10 km away from the city center of Changsha City, China) and four main water management types of protection, recovery, degradation and fisheries. The results showed that: 1) with increase in distance away from the city center, TN and TP concentrations in small water bodies and the percentage of polluted samples (IV ∼ inferior V) showed an increasing trend. 2) The degree of protection of small urban water bodies in the study area has not been synchronistic with urban expansion. The protected water bodies (long-term protected and recovering) are mainly distributed in the <5 km distance band, and anthropogenic disturbances (degraded water bodies and small water bodies used for fish farming) were mainly distributed in the 5–10 km and >10 km distance bands. Also, degraded and fish-managed water bodies had higher TN and TP contents than protected and recovering water bodies, but their TN:TP ratios were significantly lower. 3) Overall, urban expansion and water body management contributed 55.8% of the variance of TN and TP concentrations and TN:TP ratios in the study area. Water body management alone contributed 22.2%, which was higher than the contribution of urban expansion (7.6%). This shows that the insufficient application of water environmental protection measures has significantly changed the spatial distribution patterns of N and P concentrations and TN:TP ratios in urban small water bodies as the Changsha urban area has expanded. In the process of urban expansion, the simultaneous development of urban water ecological management is essential to ensure the health protection of the urban water environment.

Although long yield time series are available in Europe, few studies have been conducted to analyze them in order to investigate the impact of adverse climate events on yield shocks under current and future climate conditions. Here we designated the lowest 10th percentile of the relative yield anomaly as yield shock and analyzed subnational wheat yield shocks across Europe during the last four decades. We applied a data-driven attribution framework to quantify primary climate drivers of wheat yield shock probability based on machine learning and game theory, and used this framework to infer the most critical climate variables that will contribute to yield shocks in the future, under two climate change scenarios. During the period 1980–2018, our attribution analysis showed that 32% of the observed wheat yield shocks were primarily driven by water limitation, making it the leading climate driver. Projection to future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 suggested an increased risk of yield shock and a paradigm shift from water limitation dominated yield shock to extreme warming induced shocks over 2070–2099: 46% and 54% of areas were primarily driven by extreme warming under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. A similar analysis conducted on yields simulated by an ensemble of crop models showed that models can capture the negative impact of low water supply but missed the impact of excess water. These discrepancies between observed and simulated yield data call for improvement in crop models. © 2021. The Authors.
