This IoT is getting outstandingly universal and ubiquitous in today's society with a transformative and constructive impact on different application domains like smart and sustainable living, smart healthcare, smart agriculture, smart cities, manufacturing, and more. Consequently, there has been escalating quantitative expansion in the devices connected to IoT leading to the generation of massive volumes of data, depicting a perfect overlap of big data generation with that of IoT. These voluminous data are totally useless without any proper analytic procedure and is much more than humans will be able to process and analyze. In addition to being huge in terms of size and volume, the big data generated by IoT are of highly veracious and variable nature with a variety of data forms and quality. Further, it is highly distinguished by its velocity in terms of creation, time, processing, location dependency, and accessibility. As a result, smart analysis of such data for obtaining valuable insights is a challenging task. Intelligent data analytics is an important prerequisite to maximize the business value of IoT and realize its hyped market potential. Machine learning has the power to handle different challenges associated with IoT data and can be deployed effectively as they require minimal human intervention. In this chapter, different machine learning algorithms will be discussed along with their potential and challenges for IoT data analytics. The central goal of this chapter is to present a taxonomy of various machine learning approaches and demonstrate the implementation of different techniques so as to do higher level analysis using IoT data. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The traditional rice almanac used astronomical and climate factors to estimate yield response. However, this research integrated meteorological, agro-chemical, and soil physiographic factors for yield response prediction. Besides, the impact of those factors on the production of three major rice ecotypes has also been studied in this research. Moreover, this study found a different set of those factors with respect to the yield response of different rice ecotypes. Machine learning algorithms named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used for predicting the yield response. The SVR shows better results than XGBoost for predicting the yield of the Aus rice ecotype, whereas XGBoost performs better for forecasting the yield of the Aman and Boro rice ecotypes. The result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of three different ecotypes are in between 9.38% and 24.37% and that of R-squared values are between 89.74% and 99.13% on two different machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the explainability of the models is also shown in this study with the help of the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). © 2022 Md.

In this paper, we show how this can be now achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a large Mid-Infrared (MIR) soil spectral library (40,000 samples with Kex determined with 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7), compiled by the National Soil Survey Center of the United States Department of Agriculture. Using Partial Least Squares Regression as a baseline, we found that our implemented CNN leads to a significantly higher prediction performance of Kex when a large amount of data is available (10000), increasing the coefficient of determination from 0.64 to 0.79, and reducing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error from 135% to 31%. Furthermore, in order to provide end-users with required interpretive keys, we implemented the GradientShap algorithm to identify the spectral regions considered important by the model for predicting Kex. Used in the context of the implemented CNN on various Soil Taxonomy Orders, it allowed (i) to relate the important spectral features to domain knowledge and (ii) to demonstrate that including all Soil Taxonomy Orders in CNN-based modeling is beneficial as spectral features learned can be reused across different, sometimes underrepresented orders. © 2022 The Authors","Agriculture; Convolutional neural network; High-throughput soil characterization; Interpretability; Machine learning; Nuclear emergency response; Remediation",

This ecosystem is characterized by towering mountains, cold weather, tall trees such as pine, and dwarfed plants. Although the combination of optical and radar imagery has shown promise in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, only a handful of studies have attempted to study the dynamics of land changes in tropical montasne forests by combining the two. In this study, we examined the usage of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) and their fusion as input for LULC mapping with three modeling classifiers: traditional (maximum likelihood classification - MLC), machine learning techniques (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and kd-tree nearest neighbor), and a deep learning approach (U-Net) in a TMF in the Philippines. Also, the deforestation was characterized in terms of proximity and topographic factors. The findings revealed that the combination of S-1 and S-2 provides LULC with high accuracy of image classification. In binary classification, traditional MLC supersedes other classifiers in correctly classifying the pixels of the input imagery (average overall accuracy (OA) = 95.22; Kappa index (KI) = 90.39). Random Forest (RF) stands out in machine learning classifiers (average OA = 94.49; KI = 88.8). However, U-Net deep learning loses in binary classification but proven more robust when LULC were classified into six complex classes with an OA of 86.77 and KI of 78.89. In addition, using deep learning modeling for LULC mapping of the research site, it was determined that from 2015 to early 2022, 417.93 km2 of the study area had been deforested. Further, this research reveals that the greater the proximity of a forest to a human settlement or agricultural zone, the greater the likelihood that it will be cleared for human habitation or agriculture. Deforestation also occurred in rural locations, far from roads and bodies of water. This analysis also supports the hypothesis that deforestation can occur even in high-elevation areas. The results of this study can be utilized by policy and law makers in order to better communicate the critical nature of implementing evidence- and science-based policies to strengthen protections, as well as developing conservation and management plan for tropical montane forests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Optical; Radar; Tropical montane forest; U-Net",

The slight variance among different kinds of insects in appearance makes it hard for human experts to recognize. It is increasingly imperative to finely recognize specific insects by employing machine learning methods. In this study, we proposed a feature fusion network to synthesize feature presentations in different backbone models. Firstly, we employed one CNN-based backbone ResNet, and two attention-based backbones Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer to localize the important regions of insect images with Grad-CAM. During this process, we designed new architectures for these two Transformers to enable Grad-CAM to be applicable in such attention-based models. Then we further proposed an attention-selection mechanism to reconstruct the attention area by delicately integrating the important regions, enabling these partial but key expressions to complement each other. We only need part of the image scope that represents the most crucial decision-making information for insect recognition. We randomly selected 20 species of insects from the IP102 dataset and then adopted all 102 kinds of insects to test the classification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other advanced CNN-based models. More importantly, our attention-selection mechanism demonstrates good robustness to augmented images. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"article; attention; controlled study; decision making; human; insect; nonhuman; randomized controlled trial; residual neural network; vision; agriculture; animal; ecology; insect; machine learning; power supply; Agriculture; Animals; Ecology; Electric Power Supplies; Humans; Insecta; Machine Learning"

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a datadriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC. © 2021 by the authors.

Undoubtedly the success of the system would be impacted on crop productivity, where failure would impact severely. Like many other cyber-physical systems, one of the growing challenges to avoid system adversity is to ensure the system's security, privacy, and trust.

Research for developing models of flood predictions has been ongoing for the past few years. These models are proposed and built-in proportion for risk reduction, policy proposition, loss of human lives, and property damages associated with floods. However, flood status prediction is a complex process and demands extensive analyses on the factors leading to the occurrence of flooding. Consequently, this research proposes an Internet of Things-based flood status prediction (IoT-FSP) model that is used to facilitate the prediction of the rivers flood situation. The IoT-FSP model applies the Internet of Things architecture to facilitate the flood data acquisition process and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are Decision Tree (DT), Decision Jungle, and Random Forest, for the flood prediction process. The IoT-FSP model is implemented in MATLAB and Simulink as development platforms. The results show that the IoT-FSP model successfully performs the data acquisition and prediction tasks and achieves an average accuracy of 85.72% for the three-fold cross-validation results. The research finding shows that the DT scores the highest accuracy of 93.22%, precision of 92.85, and recall of 92.81 among the three ML algorithms. The ability of the ML algorithm to handle multivariate outputs of 13 different flood textual statuses provides the means of manifesting explainable artificial intelligence and enables the IoT-FSP model to act as an early warning and flood monitoring system. © 2022 Firas Mohammed Aswad et al., published by De Gruyter.","explainable artificial intelligence; flood prediction; Internet of Things; machine learning; multivariate classification","Data acquisition; Decision trees; Disasters; Floods; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Agriculture industries; Explainable artificial intelligence; Flood prediction; Human being; Machine learning algorithms; Multivariate classification; Natural disasters; Prediction modelling; Risks reduction; Tree-based; Internet of things"

Due to the requirements of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters. The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches. We have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks. In addition, this research helps to create friendlier environments and efficient agricultural productions for the migration of people to the cities. © 2020 by the authors.

In the present Part 2, original contributions comprise, at the Marr five levels of system understanding: (1) an innovative, but realistic EO optical sensory image-derived semantics-enriched ARD co-product pair requirements specification. First, in the pursuit of third-level semantic/ontological interoperability, a novel ARD symbolic (categorical and semantic) co-product, known as Scene Classification Map (SCM), adopts an augmented Cloud versus Not-Cloud taxonomy, whose Not-Cloud class legend complies with the standard fully-nested Land Cover Classification System’s Dichotomous Phase taxonomy proposed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Second, a novel ARD subsymbolic numerical co-product, specifically, a panchromatic or multi-spectral EO image whose dimensionless digital numbers are radiometrically calibrated into a physical unit of radiometric measure, ranging from top-of-atmosphere reflectance to surface reflectance and surface albedo values, in a five-stage radiometric correction sequence. (2) An original ARD process requirements specification. (3) An innovative ARD processing system design (architecture), where stepwi se SCM generation and stepwise SCM-conditional EO optical image radiometric correction are alternated in sequence. (4) An original modular hierarchical hybrid (combined deductive and inductive) computer vision subsystem design, provided with feedback loops, where software solutions at the Marr two shallowest levels of system understanding, specifically, algorithm and implementation, are selected from the scientific literature, to benefit from their technology readiness level as proof of feasibility, required in addition to proven suitability.

A crucial component of food security is ensuring and maintaining safe and high-quality goods, which the supply chain process should take into due deliberation. To enhance the food supply chain, organic and wholesome food items should be encouraged. Although packaged goods are evaluated and approved by legal authorities, there is no mechanism in place for testing and assessing the market’s available supply on a regular basis. As a result, food manufacturers are compelled to provide nutritious and healthy products. In this research, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence-based faster regions with convolutional neural networks (XAI-based Faster RCNN) model to evaluate the contents of the food items through user-friendly web-based front-end design and QR code. To validate each communication token in the network, an elliptic curve integrated encrypted scheme (ECIES) based on blockchain technology is utilized. Additionally, artificial rabbit optimization (ARO) is used to register each user and assign him a key. The user will gain a deeper understanding of machine learning (ML) and AI applications using the XAI technique. An EAI-based Faster RCNN model is proposed to help digitize information about food products, rapidly retrieve the information, and discover any hidden information in the quick response (QR) code that could have impacted the safety and quality of the food. The results of the experiments indicated that the proposed method requires less response time than other existing methods with the increase of payload and users. The Shapley additive explanation is used to obtain a legal plea for the laboratory test based on the nutritional information present in the QR code.

However, improving agricultural productivity requires proper identification and minimization of diseases that degrade both the quality and quantity of the crops. The scientific community has stressed that the use of recent technologies such as deep learning, the internet of things, computer vision, etc. are vital to address various challenges in the agriculture sector. Furthermore, the use of computer vision to automatically identify diseases is growing in popularity. This paper provides a comparative analysis of six pre-trained deep learning models, namely VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and Xception, for disease detection in cucumber plants. The pre-trained models are fine-tuned using transfer learning and evaluated using different metrics such as training accuracy, testing accuracy, and the number of epochs. The results obtained demonstrate that VGG16, despite being the smallest model in terms of the number of layers, outperforms the rest of the models in all of the evaluation metrics. The VGG16 models obtain testing accuracy of 98% and training accuracy of 99.91% while being trained for 8 epochs. In addition, it is observed that models with a larger number of layers, such as ResNet50 and ResNet101, exhibit fluctuations in accuracy while training due to the execution of fairly large models on a comparatively small dataset. However, InceptionV3 and Xception, despite having a greater number of layers, perform better than ResNet models due to the presence of Inception modules which are better equipped to detect different-sized targets. The findings of this study may be utilized to optimize the best-performing models for disease classification in other plants, and the fine-tuned VGG16 model can be integrated with mobile devices for real-time disease classification. © 2018-2023, Rangsit University.","cucumber disease classification; deep learning; digital agriculture; plant disease; transfer learning",

This complex disease is associated with significant socioeconomic burden, reduced work productivity, unemployment, and other social determinants of health (SDOH) disparities. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of SDOH on obesity prevalence among adults in Shelby County, Tennessee, the United States, using a geospatial machine learning approach. Methods: Obesity prevalence was obtained from the publicly available 500 Cities database of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and SDOH indicators were extracted from the US census and the US Department of Agriculture. We examined the geographic distributions of obesity prevalence patterns, using Getis-Ord Gi* statistics and calibrated multiple models to study the association between SDOH and adult obesity. Unsupervised machine learning was used to conduct grouping analysis to investigate the distribution of obesity prevalence and associated SDOH indicators. Results: Results depicted a high percentage of neighborhoods experiencing high adult obesity prevalence within Shelby County. In the census tract, the median household income, as well as the percentage of individuals who were Black, home renters, living below the poverty level, 55 years or older, unmarried, and uninsured, had a significant association with adult obesity prevalence. The grouping analysis revealed disparities in obesity prevalence among disadvantaged neighborhoods. Conclusions: More research is needed to examine links between geographical location, SDOH, and chronic diseases. The findings of this study, which depict a significantly higher prevalence of obesity within disadvantaged neighborhoods, and other geospatial information can be leveraged to offer valuable insights, informing health decision-making and interventions that mitigate risk factors of increasing obesity prevalence. © Whitney S Brakefield, Olufunto A Olusanya, Arash Shaban-Nejad.","disease surveillance; disparities; geographic information systems; machine learning; obesity; obesity surveillance; SDOH; social determinants of health","adult; demography; human; machine learning; obesity; socioeconomics; Tennessee; United States; Adult; Humans; Machine Learning; Obesity; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Tennessee; United States"

Recent advances in IoT hardware, e.g., networks of heterogeneous embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight computer vision algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible to efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart) farm. By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large geographical distances, it is possible to collect data at different time scales, including in near real-time (i.e., with delays of only a few tens of seconds). This data can then be used for actionable insights, e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced environmental footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for IoT solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital agriculture. We couple this with discussion of economics and policy considerations that will underlie adoption of such IoT and ML technologies.

Currently, deep neural networks have been extensively applied in plant disease identification, but such approaches still suffer from low identification accuracy and numerous parameters. Hence, this paper proposes a model combining channel attention and channel pruning called CACPNET, suitable for disease identification of common species. The channel attention mechanism adopts a local cross-channel strategy without dimensionality reduction, which is inserted into a ResNet-18-based model that combines global average pooling with global max pooling to effectively improve the features’ extracting ability of plant leaf diseases. Based on the model’s optimum feature extraction condition, unimportant channels are removed to reduce the model’s parameters and complexity via the L1-norm channel weight and local compression ratio. The accuracy of CACPNET on the public dataset PlantVillage reaches 99.7% and achieves 97.7% on the local peanut leaf disease dataset. Compared with the base ResNet-18 model, the floating point operations (FLOPs) decreased by 30.35%, the parameters by 57.97%, the model size by 57.85%, and the GPU RAM requirements by 8.3%. Additionally, CACPNET outperforms current models considering inference time and throughput, reaching 22.8 ms/frame and 75.5 frames/s, respectively. The results outline that CACPNET is appealing for deployment on edge devices to improve the efficiency of precision agriculture in plant disease detection.

Crop production is highly dependent on the type, and nutrition value of soil, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall etc. Farmers lack in determining the precise requirements of a crop, crop yield, and profit. This may cause a huge loss to farmers. Therefore, there is a need for a crop recommender system. Various researchers proposed the crop recommender systems but, these systems lack in automatic prediction of nutrient requirements, and crop yield. Also, the existing systems do not consider the export and import policies, hence fails in precise profit estimation.

The proposed system is intended primarily for solving the problems faced by the aquaculture farming sector in Taiwan by designing a smart IoT-based fish monitoring and control system equipped with different IoT devices to enable real-time data collection; so that fishpond water-quality conditions and other system parameters can be readily monitored, adjusted, and assessed remotely. To predict the growth of the California Bass fish, this study also develops a deep learning model (DL) that correlates the different parameters of the smart aquaculture system. Bayesian optimization-based hyper-parameter tuning was employed to find the optimal DL model configuration to produce accurate predictions on the given experimental data set. The optimal model produces an R2 value of 0.94 and a mean square error of 0.0015, demonstrating the applicability of the model to predict the desired output. Based on the results of the experiments, the DL model can be incorporated into the autonomous feeding system, reducing the amount of leftover feed. Thus, aquaculture based on the artificial intelligence of things (AIOT) can assist fish farmers in intelligently controlling and managing different fishpond equipment remotely and assist aquaculture operators in performing professional aquaculture, lowering the industry's entry barrier, and promoting aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors","Aquaculture; Bayesian optimization; Big data; Deep neural networks; Internet of things; Smart fish farming",

School dropout is a culmination of various factors that drive children to leave school, and timely policy responses are most needed to address these underlying factors and improve school retention of children over time. However, applying ML approaches to school dropout prediction is an important challenge, especially in low-income countries, where data collection and management systems are relatively more prone to financial and technical constraints. For this reason, this study suggests using already collected household panel data to predict the probability of school dropout and explore feature importance for primary school children in Malawi through ML models. A rich set of variables is obtained in this study from the household data and used to build Random Forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Ridge and multilayer neural network (MNN) models. The study further explores how performance metrics differ when we embed the training samples' weights representing frequency in sampling design into the cost function of these ML models to discuss the implications of using household data in computational social science. LASSO and MNN models trained with sample weights become more prominent due to their higher recall rates of 80.6% and 78.8%. Compared to the baseline model trained with sample weights, the recall rate gained is roughly 56 percentage points using LASSO and 54 percentage points using MNN. Also, comparing LASSO and MNN trained with and without sample weights reveals that training models with sample weights increase the recall rate roughly by 11 percentage points for LASSO and 12 percentage points for MNN. Lastly, the paper provides a comprehensive and unified approach to better interpret the models using a game-theoretic approach – SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) – to quantify feature importance. As a result, socio-economic characteristics of children, such as working in household farming and father's education level, are among the most important features contributing to the probability of school dropout in ML models. This study argues that the weighted sample structure of household data and its wide range of variables explored through the SHAP method for feature importance can enrich the literature and yield valuable results to harness data science for society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Educational data mining; Feature importance; Machine learning; Sample weights; School dropout prediction",

Indeed, one element responsible for this situation is insect pests. Early detection of pests based on parcel images is a real challenge in the context of precision agriculture. Nowadays, technical advances in deep neural networks have led to better results in all areas, including crop health management in agriculture. Despite these satisfactory results of deep neural networks in image classification tasks, one of the drawbacks is that it is difficult to decode what the neural networks have learned. The proposed method consists of identifying and locating insect pests in crops using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The localization of insects from the input data is based on explainability methods. For this, explainability highlights the colors and shapes captured by the CNNs using visualization maps. This provides opportunities for human interaction with the learning system for validation of the results provided by the CNN models. In this study, we used over 75,000 images for 102 different pest categories from the IP102 reference dataset. Various explainability methods are combined to formally interpret insect location. The degree of combination is quantified by the mutual information score. The obtained results allow a better interpretation of the reasoning performed by the deep learning system and identified an optimal number of feature extraction layers. Consequently, we simplified a CNN model by decreasing the number of network parameters by 58.90%.

This present study aims to evaluate the comparative performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and four pre-trained deep CNN models, for automatic and rapid detections of Hispa, brown spot, leaf blast, and NPK deficiency symptoms from public and real field images. Deep learning models were trained using different public and field datasets combinations. Best accuracy was achieved for mixed public and field datasets rather than solely field or solely public datasets, with VGG19 models achieving 91.8% accuracy. Relatively simple structured CNN was found to predict phosphate deficient leaves with better performance (96% accuracy) than the other four advanced models, while VGG16 performed better for leaf blast and N deficiency identification. Likewise, ResNet50 could be recommended among the five models for the Potassium deficient leaf identification, while for the Hispa pest, VGG19 outperforms the InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG16 models, and was slightly better than the basic CNN. The implication of the study is enormous considering practical application as it deals with the complex dataset of pest, disease and nutrient deficiency. This non-invasive way of detecting different stresses of rice could help farmers in practicing precision agriculture. The findings from this study could be used to develop a user-friendly interface for the rapid and inexpensive detection of diseases and nutrition status by farmers, in a non-destructive way. Similar to rice, various biotic and abiotic stress symptoms in other economic crops could also be captured and identified by deep learning algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","CNN; Diseases; NPK deficiency; Rice; Transfer learning","Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Transfer learning; Comparative performance; Convolutional neural network; Crop production; Fungal disease; Mitigation measures; Network-based; NPK deficiency; Rice; Rice (oryza sativa); Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks"

To address this challenge, a popular approach is to design a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model that extracts visual disease features in the images and then identifies the diseases based on the extracted features. This approach performs well under simple background conditions, but has low accuracy and poor robustness under complex backgrounds. In this paper, an end-to-end disease identification model composed of a disease-spot region detector and a disease classifier (YOLOv5s + BiCMT) was proposed. Specifically, the YOLOv5s network was used to detect the disease-spot regions so as to provide a regional attention mechanism to facilitate the disease identification task of the classifier. For the classifier, a Bidirectional Cross-Modal Transformer (BiCMT) model combining the image and text modal information was constructed, which utilizes the correlation and complementarity between the features of the two modalities to achieve the fusion and recognition of disease features. Meanwhile, the problem of inconsistent lengths among different modal data sequences was solved. Eventually, the YOLOv5s + BiCMT model achieved the optimal results on a small dataset. Its Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity reached 99.23, 97.37, 97.54, and 99.54%, respectively. This paper proves that the bidirectional cross-modal feature fusion by combining disease images and texts is an effective method to identify vegetable diseases in field environments.

This work assesses the use of cloud-based artificial intelligence to detect early indicators of water stress across six container-grown ornamental shrub species. Near-infrared images were previously collected with modified Canon and MAPIR Survey II cameras deployed via a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) at an altitude of 30 meters. Cropped images of plants in no, low-, and high-water stress conditions were split into four-fold cross-validation sets and used to train models through IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service. Despite constraints such as small sample size (36 plants, 150 images) and low image resolution (150 pixels by 150 pixels per plant),Watson generated models were able to detect indicators of stress after 48 hours of water deprivation with a significant to marginally significant degree of separation in four out of five species tested (p < 0.10). Two models were also able to detect indicators of water stress after only 24 hours, with models trained on images of as few as eight water-stressed Buddleia plants achieving an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9884 across four folds. Ease of pre-processing, minimal amount of training data required, and outsourced computation make cloud-based artificial intelligence services such as IBM Watson Visual Recognition an attractive tool for agriculture analytics. Cloud-based artificial intelligence can be combined with technologies such as sUAS and spectral imaging to help crop producers identify deficient irrigation strategies and intervene before crop value is diminished. When brought to scale, frameworks such as these can drive responsive irrigation systems that monitor crop status in real-time and maximize sustainable water use. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Container-grown; Deep learning; Machine learning; Neural network; Ornamental; Precision agriculture; sUAS; Visual recognition; Water stress","Containers; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Irrigation; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Real time systems; Spectroscopy; Training aircraft; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water conservation; Area under the curves; Near- infrared images; Ornamental; Small unmanned aircrafts; sUAS; Sustainable water use; Visual recognition; Water stress; Artificial intelligence"

Prolonged droughts have negative impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, society, and the economy. Although existing drought index products are widely utilized in drought monitoring, the coarse spatial resolution greatly limits their applications on regional or local scales. Machine learning driven by remote sensing observations offers an opportunity to monitor regional scale droughts. However, the limited time range of remote sensing observations such as vegetation index (VI) resulted in a substantial gap in generating high resolution drought index products before 2000. This study generated spatiotemporally continuous Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data spanning from 1901–2018 in southwestern China by machine learning. It indicated that four Classification and Regression Tree (CART) approaches, decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT) and extra trees (ET), can provide valid local drought information by downscaling the Estación Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD) data. The in-situ SPEI dataset produced by the Penman–Monteith method was used as a benchmark to evaluate the temporal and spatial performance of the downscaled SPEI. In addition, the necessity of VI in SPEI downscaling was also assessed. The results showed that: (1) the ET-based product has the best performance (R2 = 0.889, MAE = 0.232, RMSE = 0.432); (2) the VI provides no significant improvement for SPEI re-construction; (3) topography exerts an obvious influence on the downscaling process, and (4) the downscaled SPEI shows more consistency with the in-situ SPEI compared with EEAD SPEI. The proposed method can be easily extended to other areas without in-situ data and enhance the ability of long-term drought monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.

Current LAI estimation methods at subfield scale are limited not only by the characteristics of the spatial data (pixel size and spectral information) but also by the empiricity of developed models, mostly based on vegetation indices, which do not necessarily scale spatiality (among different varieties or planting characteristics) or temporally (need for different LAI models for different phenological stages). Widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms and high-resolution small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) information provide an opportunity for spatial and temporal LAI estimation addressing the spatial and temporal limitations. In this study, considering both accuracy and efficiency, a point-cloud-based feature-extraction approach (Full Approach) and a raster-based feature-extraction approach (Fast Approach) using sUAS information were developed based on multiple growing seasons (2014–2019) to extract and generate vine-scale information for LAI estimation in commercial vineyards across California. Three known ML algorithms, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), were considered, along with hybrid ML schemes based on those three algorithms, coupled with different feature-extraction approaches. Results showed that the hybrid ML technique using RF and RVM and the Fast Approach with 9 input variables, called RVM-RFFast model, performs better than others in a visual and statistical assessments of the generated LAI being also computationally efficient. Furthermore, using the generated LAI products in the quantification of energy balance using the two-source energy balance Priestley-Taylor version (TSEB-PT) model and EC tower data, the results indicated excellent estimation of net radiation (Rn) and latent heat flux (LE), good estimation of surface heat flux (G), and poor estimation of sensible heat flux (H). Additionally, TSEB-PT sensitivity analysis performed by regenerating LAI maps based on the generated LAI map (from − 15% of the original LAI map to + 15% with a 5% gap) showed that LAI uncertainty had a major impact on G, followed by evapotranspiration partitioning (T/ET), H, LE, and Rn.

Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks, obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to 0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the problem while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in it, which allows better understanding the problem and carrying out appropriate actions. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, using Kenya as the study area, we sought to identify the key drivers that affect greening and browning trends within the 4 main land cover types (agriculture, forest, grassland and shrubland) and within an area characterised by land cover change. The methodological approach used was the random forest classification algorithm, whereby the dependent variable was represented as 4 classes of NDVI greening and browning trends (strong browning, moderate browning, moderate greening, and strong greening). The explanatory variables (n = 28) were broadly grouped into 2 categories, natural and anthropogenic, and included a number of variables as proxies for broad socio-economic development. All models showed strong performance, and the mean values for accuracy and Kappa were 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Variables that repeatedly featured as the 5 most important variables across the datasets were: travel time to an urban area, distance to towns, distance to roads, distance to rivers, slope and vulnerability to climate change impacts. When the variables were grouped by SDGs, the results obtained showed that the variables grouped under the SDGs 15 (life on land), 8 (economic growth) and 13 (climate action) cumulatively accounted for approximately 80% of the prediction of the greening and browning trends. Our results raise the following considerations to enrich on-going and future policy and planning discussions aimed at addressing LDN: the implementation of LDN should be anchored on tried and tested SLM interventions; further analysis of the drivers of greening and browning trends should be undertaken at the sub-national level; integrated approaches that lead to greater alignment across multiple development priorities, including climate change, should be promoted; and targeted enforcement of environmental legislation is needed to deter processes and activities that are likely to lead to the degradation of land. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drivers; Kenya; Land degradation-neutrality; NDVI; Random forest",

The standard WMA models the linguistic information using type-1 (T1) fuzzy sets (FSs), which have a reduced capability to model the semantics of linguistic information. Therefore, we propose a novel Enhanced WMA, which models the linguistic information using the type-2 (T2) FSs. Further, our Enhanced T2 FS-based WMA can be modified to reflect the use of interval type-2 (IT2) FSs, for modelling linguistic uncertainty. IT2 FSs are suitable when better uncertainty handling capabilities are required compared to T1 FSs, however, at a computational cost lesser than the T2 FSs. Performance of Enhanced WMA is demonstrated through a real-world crop-yield prediction problem in smart agriculture and an additional exemplar application on users’ satisfaction ratings. Further, we have compared our approach with the performance obtained from the T1 FS-based WMA and the original estimations given in the original data. We found that our Enhanced WMA provides more precise estimates than the other two with 95% confidence level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a T2 FSs method for enhancing the modeling of linguistic uncertainty in the WMA. © 2022 The Author(s).

Previous descriptions of YF’s seasonality have relied purely on climatic explanations, despite the high proportion of cases occurring in people involved in agriculture. We use a series of random forest classification models to predict the monthly occurrence of YF in humans and NHP’s across Brazil, by fitting four classes of covariates related to the seasonality of climate and agriculture (planting and harvesting), crop output and host demography. We find that models captured seasonal YF reporting in humans and NHPs when they considered seasonality of agriculture rather than climate, particularly for monthly aggregated reports. These findings illustrate the seasonality of exposure, through agriculture, as a component of zoonotic spillover.

The intelligent analysis, modeling, and management of agricultural and forest ecosystems, and of the use and protection of soils, already play important roles in securing our planet for future generations and will become irreplaceable in the future. Technical solutions must encompass the entire agricultural and forestry value chain. The process of digital transformation is supported by cyber-physical systems enabled by advances in ML, the availability of big data and increasing computing power. For certain tasks, algorithms today achieve performances that exceed human levels. The challenge is to use multimodal information fusion, i.e., to integrate data from different sources (sensor data, images, *omics), and explain to an expert why a certain result was achieved. However, ML models often react to even small changes, and disturbances can have dramatic effects on their results. Therefore, the use of AI in areas that matter to human life (agriculture, forestry, climate, health, etc.) has led to an increased need for trustworthy AI with two main components: explainability and robustness. One step toward making AI more robust is to leverage expert knowledge. For example, a farmer/forester in the loop can often bring in experience and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline—no AI can do this. Consequently, human-centered AI (HCAI) is a combination of “artificial intelligence” and “natural intelligence” to empower, amplify, and augment human performance, rather than replace people. To achieve practical success of HCAI in agriculture and forestry, this article identifies three important frontier research areas: (1) intelligent information fusion; (2) robotics and embodied intelligence; and (3) augmentation, explanation, and verification for trusted decision support. This goal will also require an agile, human-centered design approach for three generations (G). G1: Enabling easily realizable applications through immediate deployment of existing technology.

Unfortunately, especially with the most successful methods, the results are very difficult to comprehend by human experts. The application of AI in areas that impact human life (e.g., agriculture, climate, forestry, health, etc.) has therefore led to an demand for trust, which can be fostered if the methods can be interpreted and thus explained to humans. The research field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) provides the necessary foundations and methods. Historically, XAI has focused on the development of methods to explain the decisions and internal mechanisms of complex AI systems, with much initial research concentrating on explaining how convolutional neural networks produce image classification predictions by producing visualizations which highlight what input patterns are most influential in activating hidden units, or are most responsible for a model’s decision. In this volume, we summarize research that outlines and takes next steps towards a broader vision for explainable AI in moving beyond explaining classifiers via such methods, to include explaining other kinds of models (e.g., unsupervised and reinforcement learning models) via a diverse array of XAI techniques (e.g., question-and-answering systems, structured explanations). In addition, we also intend to move beyond simply providing model explanations to directly improving the transparency, efficiency and generalization ability of models. We hope this volume presents not only exciting research developments in explainable AI but also a guide for what next areas to focus on within this fascinating and highly relevant research field as we enter the second decade of the deep learning revolution.

For certain tasks, algorithms can even achieve performance beyond the human level. Unfortunately, the most powerful methods suffer from the fact that it is difficult to explain why a certain result was achieved on the one hand, and that they lack robustness on the other. Our most powerful machine learning models are very sensitive to even small changes. Perturbations in the input data can have a dramatic impact on the output and lead to entirely different results. This is of great importance in virtually all critical domains where we suffer from low data quality, i.e. we do not have the expected i.i.d. data. Therefore, the use of AI in domains that impact human life (agriculture, climate, health,..) has led to an increased demand for trustworthy AI. Explainability is now even mandatory due to regulatory requirements in sensitive domains such as medicine, which requires traceability, transparency and interpretability capabilities. One possible step to make AI more robust is to combine statistical learning with knowledge representations. For certain tasks, it can be advantageous to use a human in the loop. A human expert can - sometimes, of course not always - bring experience, domain knowledge and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline. Such approaches are not only a solution from a legal point of view, but in many application areas the “why” is often more important than a pure classification result. Consequently, both explainability and robustness can promote reliability and trust and ensure that humans remain in control, thus complementing human intelligence with artificial intelligence. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Explainable AI; Human-in-the-loop; Robustness; Trust","Domain Knowledge; Machine learning; Robustness (control systems); Computing power; Explainable artificial intelligence; Human levels; Human-in-the-loop; Large amounts; Performance; Robustness; Statistical machine learning; Training data; Trust; Knowledge representation"

However, this article highlights a very different aspect. For all its benefits, the large-scale adoption of AI technologies also holds enormous and unimagined potential for new kinds of unforeseen threats. Therefore, all stakeholders, governments, policy makers, and industry, together with academia, must ensure that AI is developed with these potential threats in mind and that the safety, traceability, transparency, explainability, validity, and verifiability of AI applications in our everyday lives are ensured. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure the use of trustworthy and ethically reliable AI and to avoid the misuse of AI technologies. Achieving this will require a concerted effort to ensure that AI is always consistent with human values and includes a future that is safe in every way for all people on this planet.

However, poor seasonal and regional adaptabilities and low cooling power density of the RC technology confine its effective applications only in hot seasons and regions with RC-friendly ambient conditions. Similarly, a solar thermal collector cannot work at night and is of little value when heat is needless. To tackle these challenges, a hybrid solar photothermic and radiative cooling (PT-RC) collector equipped with a rotatable absorber/emitter panel is proposed and experimentally investigated. This dual-mode collector can flexibly switch between PT and RC to match specific energy demands in different scenarios. The daily solar thermal efficiency of the PT-RC system at zero-reduced temperature reached 50.4%, a typical level of flat-plate solar water heating systems. The PT-RC system could not provide cooling energy during most daytime hours. However, the system could easily achieve nighttime cooling, with the cooling power of the collector decreasing from about 60 to 50 W/m2 as the circulated water being continuously cooled down from around 20 to 12 °C. The average nocturnal cooling power of the PT-RC collector ranged from 30.5 to 57.5 W/m2 in a multi-night RC test.

There exist different ways, including physical-based and data-driven approaches, to estimate evapotranspiration. Here, the physical-based model (the surface energy balance system, SEBS), data-driven models (using three machine learning techniques, deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF), and symbolic regression (SR)), and hybrid model were compared using the FLUXNET2015 dataset. More importantly, different search strategies were investigated to optimize the network architecture and to explore the maximum accuracy of data-driven models. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was introduced to quantify the contributions of input features to evapotranspiration estimation. The results show that there is a large error in the SEBS model with RMSE of 121 W m−2, while the data-driven models acquire the best evapotranspiration estimation with RMSE of 32–53 W m−2. The hybrid approach, whose RMSE is 60 W m−2, improves the SEBS model but still underperforms data-driven models. The complexity of data-driven models influences the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimations. By optimizing the network architecture, DNN and RF obtain results with similar precision. But the performance of SR, which generates a simple algebraic formula for evapotranspiration estimation, is significantly degraded. SHAP reveals that all models regard net radiation as the most crucial feature. The SEBS and hybrid models attach much importance to temperature and humidity. Three data-driven models learn the different relationships between input features and evapotranspiration. The DNN-based model is likely to learn a relatively correct relationship among the data-driven models because it has a similar feature importances pattern with physical-based and hybrid models. © 2021","Data-driven; Evapotranspiration; Hybrid modeling; Physical-based","Decision trees; Evapotranspiration; Network architecture; Data driven; Data driven modelling; Hybrid modelling; Neural-networks; Physical based modeling; Physical-based; Random forests; Surface energy balance systems; Symbolic regression; Systems modelling; Deep neural networks; accuracy assessment; comparative study; energy balance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; machine learning; numerical model; physical analysis"

To achieve this goal, a prediction rice yield model was constructed, based on soil data, remote sensing data (optical and radar), climatic data, and farming practices. The dataset was collected from a rice crop surface of 89.2 ha cultivated continuously for a 5-year period and was analyzed with machine learning (ML) systems. A variational autoencoder (VAE) for reconstructing the input data of the prediction model was applied, resulting in MAE of 0.6 tn/ha, with an average yield for the study fields and period measured at 9.6 tn/ha. VAE learns the original input data representation and transforms them in a latent feature space, so that the anomalies and the discrepancies of the data are reduced. The reconstructed data by VAE provided a more sophisticated and detailed ML model, improving our knowledge about the various correlations between soil, N management parameters, and yield. Both optical and radar imagery and the climatic data were found to be of high importance for the model, as indicated by the application of XAI (explainable artificial intelligence) techniques.

While AI focuses on providing a “human” garb for computing devices, thereby making them “intelligent” devices, IoT relies on interfaces between sensors and the environment to make “intelligent” decisions. Recently, the convergence of AI and IoT – also referred to as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) – is seen as a real opportunity to refurbish the public service delivery formats. However, there is limited understanding as to how AIoT could contribute to the improvisation of public service delivery.

Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive-explanatory study takes a qualitative approach. It entails a thorough examination of the drivers and barriers of integrating AI and IoT in the public sector.

New data streams (""big data"") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of ""new""modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine ""old""and ""new""modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem.

One of the most important challenges in data gathering and examining accurate data is “energy consumption.” However, continuously changing environmental conditions, mobility in devices and extreme resource usage, such as battery capacity in WSNs collectively contribute to a high possibility of redundant data transmission thus making it tremendously hard to achieve a satisfactory network lifetime. Additionally, these environmental monitoring applications periodically senses and aggregate data which usually exhibits high temporal and spatial redundancies. As a result, exploiting these redundancies is essential for both resource utilization, as well as accurate data transmission. Since a huge amount of energy is exhausted in transmitting the redundant data, which has become a bottleneck in scaling such applications. In this context, this article provides a thorough examination of existing energy-efficient redundant data transmission reduction techniques, as well as their strengths and drawbacks. The idea of redundant data transmission reduction concept is divided into three stages: the sensor nodes (SN) at the first stage, the cluster heads (CHs) at the second stage, and the base station (BS) at the third stage. Furthermore, this survey focuses on the current issues and challenges, as well as the future directions in reducing redundant data transmission for future investigation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Climate change; Data communication systems; Data reduction; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Redundancy; Sensor nodes; Surveys; Volcanoes; Data gathering; Data-transmission; Energy-consumption; Environmental conditions; Glacier melting; Network lifetime; Reduction techniques; Redundant data; Transmission reduction; Volcanic eruptions; Energy utilization"

Plant diseases can have a devastating influence towards food safety and a considerable loss in the production of agricultural products. Disease identification on the plant is essential for long‐term agriculture sus-tainability. Manually monitoring plant diseases is difficult due to time limitations and the diversity of diseases. In the realm of agricultural inputs, automatic characterization of plant diseases is widely required. Based on performance out of all image‐processing methods, is better suited for solving this task. This work investigates plant diseases in grapevines. Leaf blight, Black rot, stable, and Black measles are the four types of diseases found in grape plants. Several earlier research proposals using machine learning algorithms were created to detect one or two diseases in grape plant leaves; no one offers a complete detection of all four diseases. The photos are taken from the plant village dataset in order to use transfer learning to retrain the EfficientNet B7 deep architecture. Following the transfer learning, the collected features are down‐sampled using a Logistic Regression tech-nique. Finally, the most discriminant traits are identified with the highest constant accuracy of 98.7% using state‐of‐the‐art classifiers after 92 epochs. Based on the simulation findings, an appropriate classifier for this application is also suggested. The proposed technique’s effectiveness is confirmed by a fair comparison to existing procedures. © 2022 by the authors.

However, this aspect is rarely studied in the existing literature. Hence, the current study aimed to evaluate the contribution of view and illumination geometries to the accuracy of retrieving Leaf Chlorophyll a and b (LCab), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) using the Random Forest (RF). The experiments were performed on various input variable scenarios where per-pixel geometric covariates, i.e. View and Sun Zenith Angles (VZA and SZA, respectively), and Relative Azimuth Angle (RAA), are excluded and included in spectral bands (SB) and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), respectively, in two semi-arid areas. The results showed that spectral bands or vegetation indices combined with geometric covariates improved the R 2 by 10–15% for LAI and 3–5% for CCC. In contrast, negligible improvements of 1–2% were achieved for LCab with cross-validation test data and independent held-out dataset, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, VZA and SZA were among the topmost influential variables in the RF models for estimating LAI, LCab, and CCC. Collectively, per-pixel geometric variables explained more than 30% of the variability in surface reflectance for all Sentinel-2 spectral bands (p &lt; 2.2e-16). Overall, the results showed that incorporating geometric covariates improved the accuracy of retrieving BVs; thus, it provided additional information that improves the predictive power of SB and SVIs. The significant benefits of the geometric variables were mainly realized for canopy-level BVs (i.e. LAI and CCC) than for LCab. Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate per-pixel view and illumination geometry in estimating LAI and CCC, especially when using wide-view sensors such as Sentinel-2. However, further testing in different phenology, site and acquisition conditions is needed to confirm the contribution of the geometric covariates to facilitate reliable retrieval of BVs from remotely sensed data and aid better agronomic decisions. © 2023 The Author(s).

In the changing climate, farmers in developing countries must adopt technologies and farming practices such as precision agriculture (PA). PA-based approaches enable farmers to cope with frequent and intensified droughts and heatwaves, optimising yields, increasing efficiencies, and reducing operational costs. Biophysical parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCab), and Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) are essential for characterising field-level spatial variability and thus are necessary for enabling variable rate application technologies, precision irrigation, and crop monitoring. Moreover, robust machine learning algorithms offer prospects for improving the estimation of biophysical parameters due to their capability to deal with non-linear data, small samples, and noisy variables. This study compared the predictive performance of sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) for estimating LAI, LCab, and CCC with Sentinel-2 imagery in Bothaville, South Africa and identified, using variable importance measures, the most influential bands for estimating crop biophysical parameters. The results showed that RF was superior in estimating all three biophysical parameters, followed by GBM which was better in estimating LAI and CCC, but not LCab, where sPLS was relatively better. Since all biophysical parameters could be achieved with RF, it can be considered a good contender for operationalisation. Overall, the findings in this study are significant for future biophysical product development using RF to reduce reliance on many algorithms for specific parameters, thus facilitating the rapid extraction of actionable information to support PA and crop monitoring activities. © 2021 by the authors.

The stipulation of expert advice for disease identification is also a challenge for the farmers. The traditional techniques adopted for plant disease detection require more human intervention, are unhandy for farmers, and have a high cost of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Therefore, there is a requirement for automating plant disease detection and classification. Deep learning and IoT-based solutions are proposed in the literature for plant disease detection and classification. However, there is a huge scope to develop low-cost systems by integrating these techniques for data collection, feature visualization, and disease detection. This research aims to develop the ‘Automatic and Intelligent Data Collector and Classifier’ framework by integrating IoT and deep learning. The framework automatically collects the imagery and parametric data from the pearl millet farmland at ICAR, Mysore, India. It automatically sends the collected data to the cloud server and the Raspberry Pi. The ‘Custom-Net’ model designed as a part of this research is deployed on the cloud server. It collaborates with the Raspberry Pi to precisely predict the blast and rust diseases in pearl millet. Moreover, the Grad-CAM is employed to visualize the features extracted by the ‘Custom-Net’. Furthermore, the impact of transfer learning on the ‘Custom-Net’ and state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19 is shown in this manuscript. Based on the experimental results, and features visualization by Grad-CAM, it is observed that the ‘Custom-Net’ extracts the relevant features and the transfer learning improves the extraction of relevant features. Additionally, the ‘Custom-Net’ model reports a classification accuracy of 98.78% that is equivalent to state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19. Although the classification of ‘Custom-Net’ is comparable to state-of-the-art models, it is effective in reducing the training time by 86.67%. It makes the model more suitable for automating disease detection. This proves that the proposed model is effective in providing a low-cost and handy tool for farmers to improve crop yield and product quality. © 2021 by the authors.

For non-autonomous systems in states with a high degree of certainty, rational approaches exist to solve, model or control stable interactions; e.g., game theory, scale-free network theory, multi-agent systems, drone swarms. As an example, guided by artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning, ML) or by human operators, swarms of drones have made spectacular gains in applications too numerous to list (e.g., crop management; mapping, surveillance and fire-fighting systems; weapon systems). But under states of uncertainty or where conflict exists, rational models fail, exactly where interdependence theory thrives. Large, coupled physical or information systems can also experience synergism or dysergism from interdependence. Synergistically, the best human teams are not only highly interdependent, but they also exploit interdependence to reduce uncertainty, the focus of this work-in-progress and roadmap. We have long argued that interdependence is fundamental to human autonomy in teams. But for A-HMTs, no mathematics exists to build from rational theory or social science for their design nor safe or effective operation, a severe weakness. Compared to the rational and traditional social theory, we hope to advance interdependence theory first by mapping similarities between quantum theory and our prior findings; e.g., to maintain interdependence, we previously established that boundaries reduce dysergic effects to allow teams to function (akin to blocking interference to prevent quantum decoherence). Second, we extend our prior findings with case studies to predict with interdependence theory that as uncertainty increases in non-factorable situations for humans, the duality in two-sided beliefs serves debaters who explore alternatives with tradeoffs in the search for the best path going forward. Third, applied to autonomous teams, we conclude that a machine in an A-HMT must be able to express itself to its human teammates in causal language however imperfectly. © 2020 by the author.

We used the leaf area index (LAI) to characterize the vegetation growth from 2007 to 2019. The LAI trends were associated with a series of driving forces, explaining the spatial and temporal change of vegetation growth. With the provision of the Wilks feature importance method, 2-month averaged air temperature and irrigation were identified as the two most important variables for monthly LAI simulation. Future climate projections based on the Regional Climate Model system (RegCM) suggested dryer and longer summers under the RCP 8.5 scenario.

Antibiotics are the most effective drugs to prevent and treat bacterial infection of mastitis. However, yet the growing problem of drug resistance, especially multidrug resistance (MDR), poses a great threat to disease control. To understand the MDR rules in bacteria of cow mastitis from national level, the main bacteria from cows with mastitis in large-scale farms were isolated and identified in China, and then drug sensitivity tests were conducted to establish a drug resistance data set. Aiming at the problem of numerous and disordered drug resistance data and lack of extensive correlations, a weighted Apriori association rule mining algorithm in conjunction with the bacterial drug resistance prevalence is proposed. We analyzed the associations between different antibiotics of key bacteria, extracted and visualized the key trends of high resistance prevalence and frequent occurrence, and discovered MDR patterns. Finally, a similarity comparison method based on Euclidean measurement was proposed to compare the relative MDR rules of different bacteria from the overall level with support, confidence, and promotion as characteristic parameters. The drug resistance data set showed that staphylococcus were the main bacteria isolated from dairy cow mastitis in China. Then based on the association rule algorithm, the important rules between different antibiotics resistance in this dataset were identified. In addition, the MDR patterns of different bacteria were visualized and analyzed by using the chord diagram. The results showed the bacteria are highly resistant to penicillin, gentamicin, and ampicillin, and most other antibiotics were linked with these three antibiotics. Finally, the high correlations and main rules in different bacteria were confirmed by a similarity comparison method. The assessment model and conclusions of this study are potentially valuable for assessing the evolution of MDR patterns, providing a scientific basis for relevant authorities to guide the rational use of antibiotics in the farming industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cow mastitis; Drug resistance; Multidrug resistance; Similarity analysis; Weighted association rule mining","Antibiotics; Association rules; Data mining; Disease control; Diseases; Losses; Statistical tests; Analysis method; Comparison methods; Cow mastiti; Data set; Drug-resistance; Multidrug resistance; Resistance analysis; Similarity analysis; Weighted association rule mining; Weighted association rules; Bacteria; algorithm; antibiotics; dairy farming; data set; disease; drug; drug resistance; pathogen; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Staphylococcus"

Classifying the severity of crop diseases is the requirement for formulating disease prevention and control strategies. However, the differences between different severity of the same crop disease are very tiny. It increases the difficulty of correct crop disease recognition. For example, at the early stage of the disease, the lesions on the leaves are not obvious. And it is very difficult to extract the features of the lesions. However, these very small color and texture differences of the lesions are the key patterns to distinguish different kinds of diseases of the same species. In order to achieve better performance in the fine-grained classification of the crop diseases, a modified light-weight convolution neural network was proposed. Multi-scale convolution kernel and coordinate attention mechanism are introduced in SqueezeNext to extract the features of the lesions accurately. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the AI challenger 2018 plant disease recognition dataset, and the recognition accuracy can reach 91.94%, which is 3.02% point higher than the original SqueezeNext model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were carried out using ReseNet50, Xception and mobilenetv2. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method was slightly better than Xception, while the model size is only 2.83 MB, which is only 3.45% of Xception. The proposed method balances the performance and efficiency very well. Thus, it is suitable for deployment on mobile terminals and other embedded resource-constrained devices, which help to promote the popularization of smart agriculture application. © 2013 IEEE.","attention mechanism; Crop disease recognition; light-weight CNN; SqueezeNext","Bandpass filters; Convolution; Crops; Disease control; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Textures; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional neural network; Crop disease; Crop disease recognition; Features extraction; Information filter; Light weight; Light-weight CNN; Neural-networks; Plant; Squeezenext; Image recognition"

Automating the process of plant disease detection with acceptable accuracy and speed using computer-aided systems could help develop an early diagnosis while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent advancements in deep neural networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of image classification and recognition systems. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the deep-learning approaches based on the pre-trained convolutional neural network models and the PyTorch framework to classify disease infections in tomato plants. Models such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNext-50_32x4d and MobileNet-V2, which relatively exhibit improved performance under different trade-offs, were tested using images captured with the natural background. Key performance indices were evaluated with varying hyperparameters during training and validation on a GPU-based system. The results show that ResNext-50_32x4d delivers the best accuracy of 90.14% (0.001 LR; 8 Batch Size), with the right hyperparameter optimization, and MobileNet-V2 delivers the lowest loss of 0.356 (0.001 LR; 16 Batch Size) during model validation for the given dataset and system constraints. ResNext-50_32x4d also performs better in inference than the other two models tested. The assessment performed in this paper will help researchers and developers decide on selecting an appropriate model for precision agriculture and smart farming deployments. © 2022 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Hyperparameter Tuning; Image Classification; Plant Disease Detection; PyTorch","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Economic and social effects; Fruits; Image enhancement; Losses; Batch sizes; Convolutional neural network; Disease detection; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Images classification; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Pytorch; Tomato leaf; Image classification"

Establishing of fast and accurate in situ nitrate monitoring approaches that could be used in the plant growth process and vegetable markets is essential. Incorporating the unique feature of N − O asymmetric stretch absorption in the mid-infrared region (1500–1200 cm−1), portable attenuated total reflectance–Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic instrument, along with the Euclidean distance-modified extreme learning machine (ED-ELM) model, was firstly employed to evaluate the nitrate contents in leafy vegetables. A total of 1224 samples of four popular vegetables (Chinese cabbage, water spinach, celery, and lettuce) were analyzed. The results indicated that the coefficient of variation of nitrate contents between different vegetable samples was large (20–30%) and the value of mean values has highly exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)–specified maximum tolerance limits. Chinese cabbage: 7550 ± 1664 mg kg−1; water spinach: 4219 ± 1029 mg kg−1; celery: 4164 ± 1214 mg kg−1; lettuce: 4322 ± 1024 mg kg−1). Moreover, The ED-ELM model showed a better performance with the RMSEP of 799.7 mg kg−1 (calibration range from 805 to 14,104 mg kg−1 and validation range from 2132 to 11,793 mg kg−1), R2 of 0.93, RPD of 2.22, the optimized calibration dataset number of 100, and the number of hidden neurons of 30.

One of the important aspects in agriculture is the analysis of soil nutrients and balancing these inputs are essential for proper crop growth. The crop productivity and the soil fertility can be improved with effective nutrient management and precise application of fertilizers. This can be done by identifying the deficient nutrients with the help of an IoT system. As traditional approach is time consuming, an IoT-enabled system is developed using the colorimetry principle which analyzes the amount of nutrients present in the soil and a fuzzy expert system is designed to recommend the quantity of fertilizers to be added in the soil. A set of 27 IF-THEN rules are framed using the Mamdani inference system by relating the input and output membership functions based on the linguistic variable for fertilizer recommendation. The experiments are conducted using MATLAB for different ranges of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K).

In recent years, advances in omics techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, paved the way for accelerating plant/crop breeding to cope with the changing climate and enhance food production. Optimized omics and phenotypic plasticity platform integration, exploited by evolving machine learning algorithms will aid in the development of biological interpretations for complex crop traits. The precise and progressive assembly of desire alleles using precise genome editing approaches and enhanced breeding strategies would enable future crops to excel in combating the changing climates.

To aid in stream restoration and management, baseline estimates of conditions and improved explanation of factors driving their degradation are needed. We used random forests to model biological conditions using a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity for small, non-tidal streams (upstream area ≤200 km2) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) of the mid-Atlantic coast of North America. We utilized several global and local model interpretation tools to improve average and site-specific model inferences, respectively. The model was used to predict condition for 95,867 individual catchments for eight periods (2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019). Predicted conditions were classified as Poor, FairGood, or Uncertain to align with management needs and individual reach lengths and catchment areas were summed by condition class for the CBW for each period. Global permutation and local Shapley importance values indicated percent of forest, development, and agriculture in upstream catchments had strong impacts on predictions. Development and agriculture negatively influenced stream condition for model average (partial dependence [PD] and accumulated local effect [ALE] plots) and local (individual condition expectation and Shapley value plots) levels. Friedman's H-statistic indicated large overall interactions for these three land covers, and bivariate global plots (PD and ALE) supported interactions among agriculture and development. Total stream length and catchment area predicted in FairGood conditions decreased then increased over the 19-years (length/area: 66.6/65.4% in 2001, 66.3/65.2% in 2011, and 66.6/65.4% in 2019). Examination of individual catchment predictions between 2001 and 2019 showed those predicted to have the largest decreases in condition had large increases in development; whereas catchments predicted to exhibit the largest increases in condition showed moderate increases in forest cover. Use of global and local interpretative methods together with watershed-wide and individual catchment predictions support conservation practitioners that need to identify widespread and localized patterns, especially acknowledging that management actions typically take place at individual-reach scales. © 2022","Benthic macroinvertebrates; Individual conditional expectation plots; Interpretable machine learning; Partial dependence and accumulated local effect plots; Random forests; Shapley values","machine learning; agriculture; article; catchment area; climate model; expectation; forest; human; land use; machine learning; macroinvertebrate; nonhuman; North America; physician; prediction; random forest; seashore; stream (river); bay; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; machine learning; procedures; river; Atlantic Ocean; Bay; Chesapeake Bay; North America; Somalia; United States; United States; Agriculture; Bays; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Rivers"

We modeled possible effects of a suite of 2030, 2060, and 2090 land-use and climate scenarios on the condition of 70,772 small streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, United States. The Chesapeake Basin-wide Index of Biotic Integrity, a benthic macroinvertebrate multimetric index, was used to represent stream condition. Land-use scenarios included four Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2) representing a range of potential landscape futures. Future climate scenarios included quartiles of future climate changes from downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP5) and a watershed-wide uniform scenario (Lynch2016). We employed random forests analysis to model individual and combined effects of land-use and climate change on stream conditions. Individual scenarios suggest that by 2090, watershed-wide conditions may exhibit anywhere from large degradations (e.g., scenarios A1B, A2, and the CMIP5 25th percentile) to small degradations (e.g., scenarios B1, B2, and Lynch2016). Combined land-use and climate change scenarios highlighted their interaction and predicted, by 2090, watershed-wide degradation in 16.2% (A2 CMIP5 25th percentile) to 1.0% (B2 Lynch2016) of stream kilometers. A goal for the Chesapeake Bay watershed is to restore 10% of stream kilometers over a 2008 baseline; our results suggest meeting and sustaining this goal until 2090 may require improvement in 11.0%–26.2% of stream kilometers, dependent on land-use and climate scenario. These results highlight inherent variability among scenarios and the resultant uncertainty of predicted conditions, which reinforces the need to incorporate multiple scenarios of both land-use (e.g., development, agriculture, etc.) and climate change in future studies to encapsulate the range of potential future conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

For example, establishing farming actions on the crop requires analyzing variables such as temperature, ambient humidity, soil moisture, solar irradiance, and Rainfall. Although these signals might contain valuable information, it is vital to mix up the monitored signals and analyze them as a whole to provide more accurate information than analyzing the signals separately. Unfortunately, monitoring all these variables results in high costs. Hence it is necessary to establish an appropriate method that allows the infer variables behavior without the direct measurement of all of them. This paper introduces a multi-sensor data fusion technique, based on a sparse representation, to find the most straightforward and complete linear equation to predict and understand a particular variable behavior based on other monitored environmental variables measurements. Moreover, this approach aims to provide an interpretable model that allows understanding how these variables are combined to achieve such results. The fusion strategy explained in this manuscript follows a four-step process that includes 1. data cleaning, 2. redundant variable detection, 3. dictionary generation, and 4. sparse regression. The algorithm requires a target variable and two highly correlated signals. It is essential to point out that the developed method has no restrictions to specific variables. Consequently, it is possible to replicate this method for the semiautomatic prediction of multiple critical environmental variables. As a case study, this work used the SML2010 data set of the UCI machine learning repository to predicted the humidity's derivative trend function with an error rate lower than 17% and a mean absolute error lower than 6%. The experiment results show that even though sparse model predictions might not be the most accurate compared to those of linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) since it is not a black-box model, it guarantees greater interpretability of the problem. © 2021 China Agricultural University","Humidity; Inference of variables; Multi-sensor data fusion; Precision agriculture; Sparse representation","Agricultural robots; Forecasting; Precision agriculture; Sensor data fusion; Soil moisture; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Data fusion strategy; Environmental variables; Extreme learning machine; Mean absolute error; Multisensor data fusion; Redundant variables; Sparse representation; UCI machine learning repository; Learning systems; air temperature; crop; environmental factor; humidity; irradiance; precision agriculture; prediction; rainfall; soil moisture"

The ethical language associated with food supply and technology is contextualised and framed by the meaning given to it by stakeholders. Failure to differentiate between these nuanced meanings can create a barrier to technology adoption and reduce the benefit derived. Scope and approach: The aim of this review paper is to consider the embedded ethical language used by stakeholders who collaborate in the adoption of AI in food supply chains. Ethical perspectives frame this literature review and provide structure to consider how to shape a common discourse to build trust in, and frame more considered utilisation of, AI in food supply chains to the benefit of users, and wider society. Key findings and conclusions: Whilst the nature of data within the food system is much broader than the personal data covered by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ethical issues for computational and AI systems are similar and can be considered in terms of particular aspects: transparency, traceability, explainability, interpretability, accessibility, accountability and responsibility. The outputs of this research assist in giving a more rounded understanding of the language used, exploring the ethical interaction of aspects of AI used in food supply chains and also the management activities and actions that can be adopted to improve the applicability of AI technology, increase engagement and derive greater performance benefits.

We find that environmental variables can predict up to 78% of the relative distribution of the poorest villages within the SBR. Exposure to cyclone hazard was the most important variable for prediction of poverty. The poorest villages were associated with relatively small areas of rural settlement (<∼30%), large areas of agricultural land (>∼50%) and moderate to high cyclone hazard. The poorest villages were also associated with less productive agricultural land than the wealthiest. Analysis suggests villages with access to more diverse livelihood options, and a smaller dependence on agriculture may be more resilient to cyclone hazard. This study contributes to the understanding of poverty-environment dynamics within Low-and middle-income countries and the associations found can inform policy linked to socio-environmental scenarios within the SBR and potentially support monitoring of work towards SDG1 (No Poverty) across the region. © 2022 The Authors","Population environment; Poverty; Random forest; Remote sensing; SDGs; Socio-ecological systems","agricultural land; census; environmental factor; livelihood; machine learning; mangrove; natural hazard; poverty; prediction; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; vulnerability; agricultural land; agriculture; article; biosphere; ecosystem; human; India; machine learning; middle income country; poverty; prediction; random forest; remote sensing; storm surge; sustainable development goal; developing country; environmental protection; income; India; questionnaire; rural population; socioeconomics; India; Sundarbans National Park; West Bengal; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Humans; Income; India; Poverty; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Therefore, monitoring water quality is essential for the management of element transport, biodiversity, and public goods in lakes. We investigated the ability of machine learning models to predict eight important water quality variables (alkalinity, pH, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, color, and pCO2) using monitoring data from 924 to 1054 lakes. The geospatial predictor variables comprise a wide range of potential drivers at the lake, buffer zone, and catchment level. We compared the performance of nine predictive models of varying complexity for each of the eight water quality variables. The best models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine in six and two cases, respectively) generally performed well on the test set (R2 = 0.28–0.60). Models were then used to predict water quality for all 180,377 mapped Danish lakes. Additionally, we trained models to predict each water quality variable by using the predictions we had generated for the remaining seven variables. This improved model performance (R2 = 0.45–0.78). Overall, the uncovered relationships were in line with the findings of previous studies, e.g., total nitrogen was positively related to catchment agriculture and chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, and alkalinity were influenced by soil type and landscape history. Remarkably, buffer zone geomorphology (curvature, ruggedness, and elevation) had a strong influence on nutrients, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth, e.g., curvature was positively related to nutrients and chlorophyll a and negatively to Secchi depth. Lake area was a strong predictor of multiple variables, especially its relationship with pH (positive), pCO2 (negative), and color (negative). Our analysis shows that the combination of machine learning methods and geospatial data can be used to predict lake water quality and improve national upscaling of predictions related to nutrient and carbon cycling. © 2022 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Geomorphology; Machine learning; Nutrients; Predictive modeling; Watershed","Alkalinity; Antennas; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Geomorphology; Lakes; Landforms; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Runoff; Support vector machines; Water quality; Buffer zones; Carbon cycling; Chlorophyll a; Geo-spatial; Machine-learning; Nutrients cycling; Predictive models; Secchi depth; Total nitrogen; Water quality variables; Decision trees; carbon dioxide; chlorophyll a; nitrogen; phosphorus; carbon; chlorophyll a; nitrogen; phosphorus; carbon dioxide; catchment; geomorphology; lowland environment; machine learning; nutrient dynamics; prediction; temperate environment; water quality; watershed; agriculture; alkalinity; Article; catchment area (hydrology); environmental monitoring; geomorphology; lake; machine learning; pH; prediction; random forest; support vector machine; water quality; watershed; ecosystem; procedures; soil; Carbon; Chlorophyll A; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil; Water Quality"

Every year, this sector faces a substantial loss in production and profit due to a large number of diseases in crops and plants. If those diseases are not detected early and taken measures for prevention, it can bring about a devastating result that can financially burden agriculture personnel. Traditional methods of detecting diseases in plants and crops offer high accuracy. However, the procedure is time-consuming, which might be insidious in most cases. Crop diseases need to be detected and cured as soon as possible as most diseases are highly contagious among crops and plants. In this paper, we have used the transfer learning approach with three pre-trained models: EfficientNetV2L, MobileNetV2, and ResNet152V2, to detect various plant diseases. We have proposed a framework to detect 38 types of leaf diseases in 14 different plants, compared the three pre-trained models based on various quantitative performance evaluation parameters, and demonstrated that EfficientNetV2L performed best with 99.63% accuracy. In the end, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique: LIME has been implemented in our model to understand the insight view of the model EfficeintNetV2L's for such prediction.

This transition will require changing crop improvement objectives to consider the entire system, and thus provide solutions to improve complex systems for higher productivity, resource use efficiency, and environmental quality. The methods and approaches that underpinned the doubling of yields during the last century may no longer be fully adequate to target crop improvement for circular agricultural systems. Here we propose a multidimensional framework for prediction with outcomes useful to assess both crop performance traits and environmental sustainability of the designed agricultural systems.

Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered “important” if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha−1, 276–345 kg ha−1, and 0.44–0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha−1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha−1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers’ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg ha−1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data. © 2022 The Authors","Accumulated local effect plot; Big data; Interaction strength; Partial dependency plot; Quantile regression; Random forest; Variable importance","crop yield; disease incidence; machine learning; productivity; regression; India"

They produce robust results with a high level of accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not provide human-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions. They usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions have been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received much interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for decision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture, related domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to background knowledge. The application of the data mining process on agricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain. In this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an XAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only consider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the semantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map model, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to provide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values contribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on providing consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and values involved in the data mining models.

Canopy spectral response in visible near-infrared (VNIR, 400–979 nm) has been widely used to estimate CNC and AGB of canopies but is often confounded by the soil background, crop type, phenological changes and environmental conditions. Machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as promising techniques for mapping CNC and AGB using canopy spectral reflectance in VNIR. However, ML and DL models’ performance relies on extensive labelled training datasets, which are often limited due to being expensive and labour intensive. We estimated CNC and AGB using state-of-the-art hyperspectral (HS) modeling approaches using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D and 2D CNN). These models, together with multispectral (MS) approaches, were evaluated in the context of a small (422) dataset for model development collected from diverse fertilization and contrasting growth conditions. A handheld field spectroradiometer was used to collect spectral reflectance samples across a wide range (more than ten-fold difference in AGB) of canopy development stages in two seasons (winter and summer) in ryegrass, and across phenological stages (from GS-25 to GS-60) in barley. Results can be summarized in four components: (1) the median values of performance metrics in 1D CNN (R2test=0.83, NRMSEtest=0.15 for CNC; R2test=0.79 (ryegrass), 0.61 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.29 (ryegrass), 0.30 (barley) for AGB) and PLSR (R2test=0.71, NRMSEtest= 0.20 for CNC; R2test=0.62 (ryegrass), 0.70 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.38 (ryegrass), 0.27 (barley) for AGB) showed the best performance for CNC and AGB prediction in the test data; (2) when evaluated with the independent measurements, 1D CNN demonstrated the best (up to 56% decrease in NRMSE) performance for AGB and was comparable to PLSR for CNC (up to 25% decrease in NRMSE than their HS and MS counterparts); (3) predictive models underperformed at low canopy cover for CNC estimation and were adversely affected by the high biomass saturation effects for AGB prediction; and (4) visible spectrum is relatively more informative to CNC models whereas the red edge to NIR spectrum is more informative to AGB models. This study demonstrates the potential and limitations of commonly available field VNIR spectral reflectance data for CNC and AGB mapping across contrasting conditions in a small dataset (&lt;500). © 2023","Crop sensing; Deep learning; Hyperspectral remote sensing; SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)","aboveground biomass; barley; canopy; grass; machine learning; nitrogen; remote sensing; spectral reflectance"

For plant disease automatic identification, classification of plant leaf images based on deep learning algorithms is currently the most accurate and popular method. Existing methods rely on the collection of large amounts of image annotation data and cannot flexibly adjust recognition categories, whereas we develop a new image retrieval system for automated detection, localization, and identification of individual leaf disease in an open setting, namely, where newly added disease types can be identified without retraining. In this paper, we first optimize the YOLOv5 algorithm, enhancing recognition ability in small objects, which helps to extract leaf objects more accurately; secondly, integrating classification recognition with metric learning, jointly learning categorizing images and similarity measurements, thus, capitalizing on prediction ability of available image classification models; and finally, constructing an efficient and nimble image retrieval system to quickly determine leaf disease type. We demonstrate detailed experimental results on three publicly available leaf disease datasets and prove the effectiveness of our system.

As more pavements get created, it becomes increasingly difficult for water to soak into the ground and this causes a decrease in the water table. Impervious structures like streets and roofs when washed with rain deposit excessive pollutants in water bodies. The overall increase in water pollution is a potential health hazard for humans and aquatic life. Hence it is necessary to take adequate measures for addressing the water pollution issue that may potentially arise due to increased urbanization. In this study, we tackle the issue using two approaches. The first approach deals with analyzing the water quality to determine its potability using fifteen different types of machine learning techniques like random forests, decision trees, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, etc. The model has been evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F-1 score. The second approach deals with identifying marine litter from beaches in many parts of the world using machine learning algorithms. We also explore the different types of beach environments and the type of litter that is found in different locations using extensive exploratory analysis. Both approaches can be used for ensuring sustainable urban development by reducing water pollution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Marine litter; Urban development; Water pollution; Water quality","machine learning; marine pollution; pollution control; sustainable development; urban development; urbanization; water pollution; water quality"

Recent progress in ML has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms theory, and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of vast amount of data (often referred to as “big data”) and low-cost computation. The adoption of ML-based approaches can be found throughout science, technology and industry, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including healthcare, biomedicine, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, data governance, policing, and marketing. Although the past decade has witnessed the increasing interest in these fields, we are just beginning to tap the potential of these ML algorithms for studying systems that improve with experience. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on geo worldwide trends (taking into account China, the USA, Israel, Italy, the UK, and the Middle East) of ML-based approaches highlighting rapid growth in the last 5 years attributable to the introduction of related national policies. Furthermore, based on the literature review, we also discuss the potential research directions in this field, summarizing some popular application areas of machine learning technology, such as healthcare, cyber-security systems, sustainable agriculture, data governance, and nanotechnology, suggesting that the “dissemination of research” in the ML scientific community has undergone the exceptional growth in the time range of 2018–2020, reaching a value of 16,339 publications. Finally, we report the challenges and the regulatory standpoints for managing ML technology. Overall, we hope that this work will help to explain the geo trends of ML approaches and their applicability in various real-world domains, as well as serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals, particularly from a technical, ethical and regulatory point of view. © 2021 Xi'an Jiaotong University","Artificial intelligence; Cybersecurity; Data governance; Healthcare; Machine learning; Nanotechnology; Research trends",

These include object detection and classification such as plants, leaves, weeds, fruits as well as animals and pests in the agricultural domain. Object detection, one of the most fundamental and difficult issues in computer vision has attracted a lot of attention lately. Its evolution over the previous two decades can be seen as the pinnacle of computer vision advancement. The detection of objects can be done via digital image processing. Machine learning has achieved significant advances in the field of digital image processing in current years, significantly outperforming previous techniques. One of the techniques that is popular is Few-Shot Learning (FSL). FSL is a type of meta-learning in which a learner is given practice on several related tasks during the meta-training phase to be able to generalize successfully to new but related activities with a limited number of instances during the meta-testing phase. Here, the application of FSL in smart agriculture, with particular in the detection and classification is reported. The aim is to review the state of the art of currently available FSL models, networks, classifications, and offer some insights into possible future avenues of research. It is found that FSL shows a higher accuracy of 99.48% in vegetable disease recognition on a limited dataset. It is also shown that FSL is reliable to use with very few instances and less training time.

However, as Al is used increasingly in real world use cases, the importance of the interpretability of and accessibility to Al systems have become major research areas. The lack of interpretability of ML based systems is a major hindrance to widespread adoption of these powerful algorithms. This is due to many reasons including ethical and regulatory concerns, which have resulted in poorer adoption of ML in some areas. The recent past has seen a surge in research on interpretable ML. Generally, designing a ML system requires good domain understanding combined with expert knowledge. New techniques are emerging to improve ML accessibility through automated model design. This paper provides a review of the work done to improve interpretability and accessibility of machine learning in the context of global problems while also being relevant to developing countries.

Food security is a matter of concern for stakeholders and policymakers as the global population is predicted to bypass 10 billion in the coming years. Crop improvement via modern breeding techniques along with efficient agronomic practices innovations in microbiome applications, and exploiting the natural variations in underutilized crops is an excellent way forward to fulfill future food requirements. In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security. © Copyright © 2021 Razzaq, Kaur, Akhter, Wani and Saleem.","abiotic stress; climate change; CRISPR/Cas; crop improvement; food security; genome editing; genomics; next-generation breeding",

Closed plant production systems (CPPSs) allow growing of any plant variety, no matter the year’s season. Artificial lighting plays an essential role in CPPSs as it promotes growth by providing optimal conditions for plant development. Nevertheless, it is a model with a high demand for electricity, which is required for artificial radiation systems to enhance the developing plants. A high percentage (40% to 50%) of the costs in CPPSs point to artificial lighting systems. Due to this, lighting strategies are essential to improve sustainability and profitability in closed plant production systems. However, no tools have been applied in the literature to contribute to energy savings in LED-type artificial radiation systems through the configuration of light recipes (wavelengths combination. For CPPS to be cost-effective and sustainable, a pre-evaluation of energy consumption for plant cultivation must consider. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods integrated into the prediction crucial variables such as each input-variable light color or specific wavelengths like red, green, blue, and white along with light intensity (quantity), frequency (pulsed light), and duty cycle. This paper focuses on the feature-selection stage, in which a regression model is trained to predict energy consumption in LED lights with specific light recipes in CPPSs. This stage is critical because it identifies the most representative features for training the model, and the other stages depend on it. These tools can enable further in-depth analysis of the energy savings that can be obtained with light recipes and pulsed and continuous operation light modes in artificial LED lighting systems. © 2022 by the authors.

With the development of automated machine learning, agricultural experts are now able to train, evaluate and make predictions using cutting edge machine learning (ML) models without the need for much ML knowledge. Although this automated approach has led to successful results in many scenarios, in certain cases (e.g., when few labeled datasets are available) choosing among different models with similar performance metrics is a difficult task. Furthermore, these systems do not commonly allow users to incorporate their domain knowledge that could facilitate the task of model selection, and to gain insight into the prediction system for eventual decision making. To address these issues, in this paper we present AHMoSe, a visual support system that allows domain experts to better understand, diagnose and compare different regression models, primarily by enriching model-agnostic explanations with domain knowledge.

Internet of Things (IoT) based smart agriculture system can play a vital role in optimising crop yield by managing crop requirements in real-Time. Interpretability can be an important factor to make such systems trusted and easily adopted by farmers. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based agriculture system that uses IoT data to monitor the environment and alerts farmers to take the required actions for maintaining ideal conditions for crop production. The strength of the proposed system is in its interpretability which makes it easy for farmers to understand, trust and use it. The use of fuzzy logic makes the system customisable in terms of types/number of sensors, type of crop, and adaptable for any soil types and weather conditions. The proposed system can identify anomalous data due to security breaches or hardware malfunction using machine learning algorithms. To ensure the viability of the system we have conducted thorough research related to agricultural factors such as soil type, soil moisture, soil temperature, plant life cycle, irrigation requirement and water application timing for Maize as our target crop. The experimental results show that our proposed system is interpretable, can detect anomalous data, and triggers actions accurately based on crop requirements. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Our understanding of nitrate dynamics has advanced substantially in the past decades, although its predominant drivers across gradients of climate, land use, and geology have remained elusive. Here we collated nitrate data from 2061 rivers along with 32 watershed characteristic indexes and developed machine learning models to reconstruct long-term mean (multi-year average) nitrate concentrations in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The trained models show similarly satisfactory model performance and can predict nitrate concentrations in chemically-ungauged places with about 70% accuracy. Further analysis revealed that five (out of 32) indexes (drivers) can explain about 70% of spatial variations in mean nitrate concentrations. The five influential drivers are nitrogen application rates Nrate and urban area Aurban% (human drivers), mean annual precipitation and temperature (climate drivers), and sand percent Sand% (soil property driver). Nitrate concentrations in undeveloped sites are primarily modulated by climate and soil property; they decrease with increasing mean discharge and Sand%. Nitrate concentrations in agriculture and urban sites increase with Nrate and Aurban% until reaching their apparent maxima around 10,000 kg/km2/yr and around 25%, respectively. Results indicate that nitrate concentrations may remain similar or increase with growing human population. In addition, nitrate concentrations can increase even without human input, as warming escalates water demand and reduces mean discharge in many places. These results allude to a conceptual model that highlights the impacts of distinct drivers: while human drivers predominate nitrogen input to land and rivers, climate drivers and soil properties modulate its transport and transformation, the balance of which determine long-term mean concentrations.

For many entities, this decision is difficult and we need another class called “maybe”, which contains a corresponding quantifiable tendency toward one of these two opposites. Human domain experts are often able to mark any entity, place it in a different class and adjust the position of the slope in the class. Moreover, they can often explain the classification space linguistically—depending on their individual domain experience and previous knowledge.

It can produce very large, multi-dimensional data sets that require sophisticated analysis tools, such as metamodeling. Advances in explainable artificial intelligence have expanded the types of metamodels that can be considered; however, constructing a well-fitting machine learning metamodel involves many tasks that can become time consuming for an analyst. Automated machine learning (autoML) can save an analyst time by automating metamodel training, tuning and testing. Using outputs of an agent-based simulation of a military ground-based air defense scenario, we compared the performance of metamodels trained using autoML and different experimental designs. We found that autoML can reasonably automate the construction of metamodels and adds robustness to the analysis by considering multiple types of metamodels; however, the type and size of experimental design can significantly impact metamodel performance. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Decision making; Design of experiments; Network security; Statistics; Analysis tools; Automated machines; Data farming; Data set; Decision makers; Machine-learning; Meta model; Metamodeling; Multidimensional data; Performance; Machine learning"

Hence, to reach the 2030 European energy efficiency target it is vital to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. An important barrier that hinders renovation projects is uncertainty regarding the expected savings. The main objective of this paper is to present two different statistical methods to estimate energy savings. The two methods are easy to implement for practitioners within the energy retrofitting industry, and at the same time has acceptable precision and reliability. The two methods are applied at 5 different food retail stores that undertook renovation in 2019. The models are trained on data from 2018 (one whole year before any of the retrofitting's took place) and are further applied to estimate the energy savings in 2021. The first method is the Tao Vanilla benchmarking method (TVB). The TVB model predict energy consumption in buildings on an hourly level. The model has received a lot of attention within the load forecasting literature and has previously proved its performance in machine learning competitions. The TVB has a straightforward specification, and the model parameters are easily understood. This is the first study that apply the TVB to estimate energy savings in a large retrofitting project within the energy and building sector. The second method relies on a more common industrial approach, which is to use weekly data and energy temperature curves to document energy savings. In addition, we demonstrate a novel approach of using broken line (BL) models to estimate energy savings. The suggested BL approach can simultaneously estimate all the model parameters and yield a full covariance matrix within a standard linear regression framework. The results from the retrofitting projects demonstrates considerable energy savings between 25% and 55%. Furthermore, both the TVB and the BL models deliver reliable precision. The estimated energy savings from both models are coinciding. This indicates that they could jointly be used to gain insight that may lead to more informed decisions for energy saving projects. The TVB model proves to be a proficient benchmarking model that can give detailed hourly information about the savings. The BL model is used to gain intrinsic details about the buildings varying cooling and heating needs depending on the outside temperature during the year. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Broken line models; Building energy retrofitting; Data driven models; Energy savings evaluation; Measurement and verification; Tao Vanilla Benchmark model","Benchmarking; Buildings; Covariance matrix; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Retail stores; Retrofitting; Benchmark models; Broken line model; Building energy; Building energy retrofitting; Data-driven model; Energy saving evaluation; Energy-savings; Line models; Measurement and verification; Tao vanillum benchmark model; Energy utilization"

Quantification of the magnitude and impact of freshwater nitrogen requires identifying key controls of nitrogen dynamics and analyzing both the past and present patterns of nitrogen flows. To tackle this challenge, we adopted a machine learning (ML) approach and built an ML-driven representation that captures spatiotemporal variability in nitrogen concentrations at global scale. Our model uses random forests to regress a large sample of monthly measured stream nitrogen concentrations onto a set of 17 predictors with a spatial resolution of 0.5-degree over the 1990–2013, including observations within the pixel and upstream drivers. The model was validated with data from rivers outside the training dataset and was used to predict nitrogen concentrations in 520 major river basins of the world, including many with scarce or no observations. We predicted that the regions with highest median nitrogen concentrations in their rivers (in 2013) were: United States (Mississippi), Pakistan, Bangladesh, India (Indus, Ganges), China (Yellow, Yangtze, Yongding, Huai), and most of Europe (Rhine, Danube, Vistula, Thames, Trent, Severn). Other major hotspots were the river basins of the Sebou (Morroco), Nakdong (South Korea), Kitakami (Japan), and Egypt's Nile Delta. Our analysis showed that the rate of increase in nitrogen concentration between 1990s and 2000s was greatest in rivers located in eastern China, eastern and central parts of Canada, Baltic states, Pakistan, mainland southeast Asia, and south-eastern Australia. Using a new grouped variable importance measure, we also found that temporality (month of the year and cumulative month count) is the most influential predictor, followed by factors representing hydroclimatic conditions, diffuse nutrient emissions from agriculture, and topographic features. Our model can be further applied to assess strategies designed to reduce nitrogen pollution in freshwater bodies at large spatial scales. © 2023 The Authors","Global water quality; Hotspot analysis; Nitrogen pollution; Random forests; Variable importance","Forestry; Health hazards; Health risks; Machine learning; Nitrogen; Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; Watersheds; Global water quality; Hotspot analyse; Hotspots; Machine learning approaches; Nitrogen concentrations; Nitrogen pollution; Pakistan; Random forests; River basins; Variable importances; Water quality; algorithm; concentration (composition); machine learning; nitrogen; river pollution; stream; water quality; Bangladesh; China; Danube River; Egypt; England; Ganges River; Honshu; Huai River; India; Indus River; Japan; Kitakami River; Mississippi River; Morocco; Nakdong River; Nile Delta; Pakistan; Poland [Central Europe]; Rhine River; Sebou River; Severn River [United Kingdom]; South Korea; Thames River [England]; Tohoku; Trent River [England]; United Kingdom; United States; Vistula River; Yangtze River; Yellow River; Yongding River [China]"

However, empirically measured pesticide dissipation half-lives are highly variable and the accurate prediction with models is challenging. This study utilized a dataset of pesticide dissipation half-lives containing 1363 datapoints, 311 pesticides, 10 plant types, and 4 plant component classes. Novel dissipation half-life intervals were proposed and predicted to account for high variations in empirical data. Four machine learning models (i.e., gradient boosting regression tree [GBRT], random forest [RF], supporting vector classifier [SVC], and logistic regression [LR]) were developed to predict dissipation half-life intervals using extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), temperature, plant type, and plant component class as model inputs. GBRT-ECFP had the best model performance with F1-microbinary score of 0.698 ± 0.010 for the binary classification compared with other machine learning models (e.g., LR-ECFP, F1-microbinary= 0.662 ± 0.009). Feature importance analysis of molecular structures in the binary classification identified aromatic rings, carbonyl group, organophosphate, =C-H, and N-containing heterocyclic groups as important substructures related to pesticide dissipation half-lives. This study suggests the utility of machine learning models in assessing the environmental fate of pesticides in agricultural crops. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dissipation half-life; Extended connectivity fingerprints; Gradient boosting regression tree; Machine Learning; Molecular structure; Pesticide","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Molecular structure; Pesticides; Random forests; Boosting regression trees; Dissipation half-life; Environmental fate; Extended connectivity fingerprint; Gradient boosting; Gradient boosting regression tree; Half lives; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Pesticide dissipations; Crops; acaricide; antinematodal agent; bactericide; fungicide; heterocyclic compound; insecticide; molluscacide; organophosphate; pesticide; pesticide; connectivity; data set; environmental fate; machine learning; molecular analysis; pesticide; prediction; regression analysis; Article; chemical structure; controlled study; crop; decision tree; environmental impact; k means clustering; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; molecular fingerprinting; prediction error; random forest; agriculture; half life time; machine learning; plant; Agriculture; Half-Life; Machine Learning; Pesticides; Plants"

Consumer buy and pay preferences for specially labeled food products (e.g., U.S. Department of Agriculture organic, raised without antibiotics, and locally raised) may promote the adoption of associated production practices by food producers. Thus, it is important to understand how consumer buy and pay preferences for specially labeled products vary with their demographics, food-relevant habits, and foodborne disease perceptions. Using both conventional statistical and novel machine learning models, this study analyzed Michigan State University Environmental Science and Policy Program annual survey data (2019) to characterize consumer buy and pay preferences regarding eight labels related to food production practices. Older consumer age was significantly associated with lower consumer willingness to pay more for labeled products. Participants who prefer to shop in nonconventional grocery stores were more willing to buy and pay more for labeled products. Our machine learning models provide a new approach for analyzing food safety and labeling survey data and produced adequate average prediction accuracy scores for all eight labels. The label ""raised without antibiotics""had the highest average prediction accuracy for consumer willingness to buy. Thus, the machine learning models may be used to analyze food survey data and help develop strategies for promoting healthy food production practices.

In recent years, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b) unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI.

This study aimed to address the relationship between Sargassum distribution in the Yellow Sea (YS) and the East China Sea (ECS) and environmental variables for determining Sargassum distribution toward the Korean Peninsula. From feature importance ranking, we found that sea surface temperature (SST) is the most influential environmental variable in Sargassum distribution. From variables such as sea surface height (SSH), eastward seawater velocity (uo), and northward seawater velocity (vo), it was observed that Sargassum patches were not distributed in the southeast below 29 °N. Subsequently, we employed bagged tress models to evaluate the specific sensitivity of each environmental variable to Sargassum distribution. This model showed the best quantitative and qualitative performance when trained with physical and geographical variables. When estimating expanded areas of Sargassum distribution over time with the change in SST, a sider distribution range of Sargassum patches than usual and an early inflow into the Korean Peninsula were observed when the SST increased from the original. In addition, we found that the tolerable and favorable SST for Sargassum was 12–20 and 18°C, respectively. These results will enhance the understanding of the relationship between environmental variables and Sargassum distribution and provide valuable data for establishing a pre-disaster system for Sargassum blooms flowing toward the Korean Peninsula.

However, rapid expansion of developmental projects, agriculture, and urban areas threaten the country’s rich biodiversity. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies like AI in Indian forests and biodiversity sectors can help in effective monitoring, management, and conservation of biodiversity and forest resources. We conducted a systematic search of literature related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) in the forestry sector and biodiversity conservation across globe and in India (using ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar). Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India.

The quality of the agriculture is impacted by the pests and diseases infected on the plants. Many researches proposed traditional image processing techniques to identify the diseases and design a recommendation system but all these are expensive and inaccurate systems, which are not affordable by farmers. When a new era known as “Machine Learning” as evolved, researchers extracted necessary features from the plant images and converted them into csv files to classify the diseases in plants using these approaches. Even these approaches are time consuming, so researchers are moved to deep learning approaches in which the intermediate steps takes places automatically in between input and output like pre-processing feature extraction. In this paper, the model studied about different deep learning approaches available on the disease detection system in various plants. Among the deep learning models, the researchers who have implemented transfer learning approaches have obtained high accuracy and few have achieved good kappa cohen values also. In traditional models the system needs to assume random weights for the neurons to produce the dot vectors of every layers. These assumed values some times may give more error rate which results in back propagation. Transfer learning helps the model to get the optimal weights without assumptions of each neuron from the pre-trained model it implements. The major advantage of any pre-trained model lies in faster training of network with millions of different categories images. One of the popular dataset used by most of the researchers for this study is “ImageNet”.

At the field level, NO3 leaching is highly variable due to interactions among soil, weather and crop management factors, but the relative effects of these drivers have not been quantified on a global scale. Using a global database of 82 field studies in temperate rainfed cereal crops with 961 observations, our objectives were to (a) quantify the relative importance of environmental and management variables to identify key leverage points for NO3 mitigation and (b) determine associated changes in crop productivity and potential tradeoffs for high and low NO3 loss scenarios. Machine learning algorithms (XGboost) and feature importance analysis showed that the amount and intensity of rainfall explained the most variability in NO3 leaching (up to 24 kg N ha-1), followed by nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate and crop N removal. In contrast, other soil and management variables such as soil texture, crop type, tillage and N source, timing and placement had less importance. To reduce N losses from global agriculture under changing weather and climatic conditions, these results highlight the need for better targeting and increased adoption of science-based, locally adapted management practices for improving N use efficiency. Future policy discussions should support this transition through different instruments while also promoting more advanced weather prediction analytics, especially in areas susceptible to extreme climatic variation. © 2022 The Author(s).

But could the cure be worse than the disease? Understanding low probability, yet plausible, high-impact cases is critical to prudent climate risk management and SAI deliberation. But analyses of such high impact outcomes are lacking in SAI research. This paper helps resolve this gap by investigating SAI's contributions to global catastrophic risk. We split SAI's contributions to catastrophic risk into four interrelated dimensions: 1. Acting as a direct catastrophic risk through potentially unforeseen ecological blowback. 2. Interacting with other globally catastrophic hazards like nuclear war. 3. Exacerbating systemic risk (risks that cascade and amplify across different systems); 4. Acting as a latent risk (risk that is dormant but can later be triggered). The potential for major unforeseen environmental consequences seems highly unlikely but is ultimately unknown. SAI plausibly interacts with other catastrophic calamities, most notably by potentially exacerbating the impacts of nuclear war or an extreme space weather event. SAI could contribute to systemic risk by introducing stressors into critical systems such as agriculture. SAI's systemic stressors, and risks of systemic cascades and synchronous failures, are highly understudied. SAI deployment more tightly couples different ecological, economic, and political systems. This creates a precarious condition of latent risk, the largest cause for concern. Thicker SAI masking extreme warming could create a planetary Sword of Damocles. That is, if SAI were removed but underlying greenhouse gas concentrations not reduced, there would be extreme warming in a very short timeframe. Sufficiently large global shocks could force SAI termination and trigger SAI's latent risk, compounding disasters and catastrophic risks. Across all these dimensions, the specific SAI deployment, and associated governance, is critical. A well-coordinated use of a small amount of SAI would incur negligible risks, but this is an optimistic scenario. Conversely, larger use of SAI used in an uncoordinated manner poses many potential dangers. We cannot equivocally determine whether SAI will be worse than warming. For now, a heavy reliance on SAI seems an imprudent policy response.

This leads to significant crop loss in different parts of the world. To provide effective solutions, several smart agriculture solutions are deployed for the control of pests and plant diseases using vision-based machine learning techniques. Despite rapid growth in the field, not many methods have been explored for their suitability in real-time applications. Several open challenges need to be addressed for the applicability of machine learning techniques in IoT-based smart agriculture solutions. Starting from data capturing methods and the availability of public datasets, the present paper provides a comprehensive review of vision-based machine learning techniques for plant disease detection. Initially, 1337 articles were selected from various scholarly resources to perform the survey. Based on the saliency of approaches, 148 articles are reviewed in this paper. Interestingly, a significant amount of research in this direction is taken up by Chinese and Indian researchers, and deep learning is the current research trend, as in other fields. The review concludes that a majority of existing methods exhibit their efficacy on public datasets captured mostly in controlled environmental conditions, but their generalization capability for in-field plant disease detection has not been explored. Lightweight CNN-based methods, on the other hand, have been designed for a limited number of diseases only, and are generally trained on small datasets. The scarcity of large-scale, in-field public datasets is one of the major bottlenecks in developing solutions that can work for a wide variety of plant diseases. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image processing; Machine learning; Plant disease detection","Computer vision; Crops; Deep learning; Disease control; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease detection; Images processing; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Public dataset; Vision based; Convolutional neural networks"

Despite the successes of AI in other “less-technical” domains, human-AI synergies are required to ensure user engagement and provide interactive expert knowledge. This is notably the case of applications related to art since the appreciation and the comprehension of art is considered to be an exclusively human capacity. This paper discusses the potential human-AI synergies aiming at explaining the history of art and artistic style transfer. This work is done in the context of the “Smart Photobooth” a project which runs within the AI & Art pavilion. The latter is a satellite event of Esch2022 European Capital of Culture whose main aim is to reflect on AI and the future of art. The project is mainly an outreach and knowledge dissemination project, it uses a smart photo-booth, capable of automatically transforming the user’s picture into a well-known artistic style (e.g., impressionism), as an interactive approach to introduce the principles of the history of art to the open public and provide them with a simple explanation of different art painting styles. Whereas some of the cutting-edge AI algorithms can provide insights on what constitutes an artistic style on the visual level, the information provided by human experts is essential to explain the historical and political context in which the style emerged. To bridge this gap, this paper explores Human-AI synergies in which the explanation generated by the eXplainable AI (XAI) mechanism is coupled with insights from the human expert to provide explanations for school students as well as a wider audience.

It is useful to timely collect the AGB data to monitor wheat growth and to build high-yielding wheat groups. However, as traditional AGB data acquisition relies on destructive sampling, it is difficult to adapt to the modernization of agriculture, and the estimation accuracy of spectral data alone is low and cannot solve the problem of index saturation at later stages. In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an RGB camera and the real-time kinematic (RTK) was used to obtain imagery data and elevation data at the same time during the critical fertility period of wheat. The cumulative percentile and the mean value methods were then used to extract the wheat plant height (PH), and the color indices (CIS) and PH were combined to invert the AGB of wheat using parametric and non-parametric models. The results showed that the accuracy of the model improved with the addition of elevation data, and the model with the highest accuracy of multi-fertility period estimation was PLSR (PH + CIS), with R2, RMSE and NRMSE of 0.81, 1248.48 kg/ha and 21.77%, respectively. Compared to the parametric models, the non-parametric models incorporating PH and CIS greatly improved the prediction of AGB during critical fertility periods in wheat. The inclusion of elevation data therefore greatly improves the accuracy of AGB prediction in wheat compared to traditional spectral prediction models. The fusion of UAV-based elevation data and image information provides a new technical tool for multi-season wheat AGB monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.","AGB; color indices; elevation; regression models; UAV RGB image; wheat",

However, microbial functioning, as well as temporal differences and mechanisms causing microbial community shifts, remains comparably little explored. Here, using Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system containing a low microbial diversity, we studied temporal changes in microbial community structure and functioning. For that, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the composition of bacteria and fungi and analyzed the microbially derived metabolome throughout the fermentation process in all four seasons in both 2018 and 2019. We show that microbial communities and the metabolome changed throughout the fermentation process in each of the four seasons, with metabolome diversity increasing throughout the fermentation process. Across seasons, bacterial and fungal communities as well as the metabolome driven by 10 indicator microorganisms and six metabolites varied even more. Daily average temperature in the external surroundings was the primary determinant of the observed temporal microbial community and metabolome changes. Collectively, our work reveals critical insights into patterns and processes determining temporal changes of microbial community composition and functioning. We highlight the importance of linking taxonomic to functional changes in microbial ecology to enable predictions of human-relevant applications. IMPORTANCE We used Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system to show that microbiome composition changes more dramatically across seasons than throughout the fermentation process within seasons. These changes translate to differences in the metabolome as the ultimate functional outcome of microbial activity, suggesting that temporal changes in microbiome composition are translating into functional changes. This result is striking as it suggests that microbial functioning, despite controlled conditions in the fermentors, fluctuates over season along with external temperature differences, which threatens a reproducible food taste. As such, we believe that our study provides a stepping-stone into novel taxonomy-functional studies that promote future work in other systems and that also is relevant in applied settings to better control surrounding conditions in food production.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from genetic (G), environmental (E), and management (M) conditions is a long-standing challenge with implications to agriculture, medicine, and conservation. Most methods reduce the factors in a dataset (feature engineering) in a subjective and potentially oversimplified manner. Deep neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MPL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can overcome this by allowing the data itself to determine which factors are most important. CNN models were developed for predicting agronomic yield from a combination of replicated trials and historical yield survey data. The results were more accurate than standard methods when tested on held-out G, E, and M data (r = 0.50 vs. r = 0.43), and performed slightly worse than standard methods when only G was held out (r = 0.74 vs. r = 0.80). Pre-training on historical data increased accuracy compared to trial data alone.

However, the models used for this approach tend to become black-box models, in the sense that it is difficult to trace characters that are the base for the classification. The interpretability is therefore limited and the explanatory factors may not be based on reasonable visible characters. We investigate the explanatory factors of recent machine learning and deep learning models for plant classification tasks. Based on a Daucus carota and a Beta vulgaris image data set, we implement plant classification models and compare those models by their predictive performance as well as explainability. For comparison we implemented a feed forward convolutional neuronal network as a default model. To evaluate the performance, we trained an unsupervised Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable model as well as a convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction and rely on a support vector machine for classification. The explanatory factors of all models were extracted and analyzed. The experiments show, that feed forward convolutional neuronal networks (98.24% and 96.10% mean accuracy) outperforms the Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable pipeline (92.08% and 94.31% mean accuracy) as well as the convolutional autoenceoder pipeline (92.38% and 93.28% mean accuracy) based approaches in terms of classification accuracy, even though not significant for Beta vulgaris images. Additionally, we found that the neuronal network used biological uninterpretable image regions for the plant classification task. In contrast to that, the unsupervised learning models rely on explainable visual characters. We conclude that supervised convolutional neuronal networks must be used carefully to ensure biological interpretability.

Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s).

The experimental results showed that the proposed OplusVNet can more effectively solve the problem caused by uneven data volume and has higher recognition accuracy, especially for image categories with a relatively small data volume. Compared with the state of the art networks, the generalization ability of the proposed OplusVNet network is stronger for classifying diseases. The classification accuracy of the model prediction results was 0.99, indicating the model can be used as a reference for crop image classification. © 2022 by the authors.","citrus diseases; classification; convolutional neural network; field image; smartphone image; transfer learning",

However, pesticides may inadvertently harm bees, which are valuable as pollinators. Thus, candidate pesticides in development pipelines must be assessed for toxicity to bees. Leveraging a dataset of 382 molecules with toxicity labels from honey bee exposure experiments, we train a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees. We compare two representations of the pesticide molecules: (i) a random walk feature vector listing counts of length-L walks on the molecular graph with each vertex- and edge-label sequence and (ii) the Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) structural key fingerprint (FP), a bit vector indicating the presence/absence of a list of pre-defined subgraph patterns in the molecular graph. We explicitly construct the MACCS FPs but rely on the fixed-length-L random walk graph kernel (RWGK) in place of the dot product for the random walk representation. The L-RWGK-SVM achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (mean over 2000 runs) of 0.81, 0.68, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively, on the test data set - with L = 4 being the mode optimal walk length. The MACCS-FP-SVM performs on par/marginally better than the L-RWGK-SVM, lends more interpretability, but varies more in performance. We interpret the MACCS-FP-SVM by illuminating which subgraph patterns in the molecules tend to strongly push them toward the toxic/non-toxic side of the separating hyperplane. © 2022 Author(s).",,"Food products; Molecules; Pesticides; Random processes; Statistical tests; Toxicity; Vectors; Access system; Crop yield; Features vector; Graph kernels; Honey bee; Molecular graphs; Random Walk; Subgraphs; Support vectors machine; Yield quality; Support vector machines; pesticide; animal; bee; support vector machine; Animals; Bees; Pesticides; Support Vector Machine"

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

Two training datasets, model evaluation metrics, and three visualization methods were used to objectively assess, compare, and interpret five Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models. The results show that the dataset configuration had a significant impact on the classification results, as all models achieved over 96.1% accuracy on dataset A (training-to-testing = 2.4:1.0) compared to 89.4–93.9% accuracy on dataset B (training-to-testing = 1.0:3.7). VGG-19 achieved the highest accuracy of 100.0% on dataset A and 93.9% on dataset B. Moreover, for networks of the same framework, the model size, accuracy, and training and testing times increased as the model depth (number of layers) increased. Furthermore, feature visualization, strongest activations, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations techniques were used to show the understanding of apple images by different trained models, as well as to reveal how and why the models make classification decisions. These results improve the interpretability and credibility of CNN-based models, which provides guidance for future applications of deep learning methods in agriculture. © 2023 by the authors.","apple varieties; Convolutional Neural Network; model interpretability; transfer learning; visualization methods",

However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the nanoparticle uptake and the underlying physiological mechanism. Machine learning has great potential for understanding the biological effects of nanoparticles. However, its interpretability is a challenge for building trust and providing insights into the learned relationships. Herein, we systematically investigated how the factors influence nanoparticle uptake during seed priming by ZnO nanoparticles and its effects on seed germination. The properties of the nanoparticles, priming solution, and seeds were considered. Post hoc interpretation and model-based interpretation of machine learning were integrated into two ways to understand the mechanism of nanoparticle uptake during seed priming and its biological effects on seed germination. The results indicated that nanoparticle concentration and ionic strength influenced the shoot fresh weight mainly by controlling the nanoparticle uptake. The nanoparticle uptake had a significant slowdown when the nanoparticle concentration exceeded 50 mg L−1. Although other factors, such as zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter, had no obvious effects on nanoparticle uptake, their biological effects cannot be ignored. This approach can promote the safer-by-design strategy of nanomaterials for sustainable agriculture. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cultivation; II-VI semiconductors; Ionic strength; Machine learning; Seed; Biological effects; Crop growth; Environmental stress; Integrating machines; Interpretation methods; Machine-learning; Nanoparticle concentrations; Nanoparticle uptakes; Seed germination; Seed priming; ZnO nanoparticles; nanoparticle; germination; machine learning; plant seed; seedling; Germination; Machine Learning; Nanoparticles; Seedlings; Seeds"

The prerequisite for disease and pest control is accurate detection. Traditional crop disease and pest detection methods rely on human labors and instructions. However, these methods can no longer meet the requirements of scientific research and production, such as detection efficiency, accuracy, and application scenarios. As a main stream of machine learning, deep learning can extract features of objects from large-scale datasets automatically and efficiently, thereby releasing traditional methods from manual feature extraction. Applying deep learning, combined with image processing techniques, to detect crop disease and pest becomes an inevitable trend of precision agriculture in the future. The key techniques in crop disease and pest detection depend on agricultural data. After reviewing the state of the art of key techniques in this domain, including data acquisition, data pre-processing, data augmentation, deep learning network optimization, data visualization, and explainability of results, the challenges of applying these key techniques were detected and summarized. Lastly, potential solutions were explored to highlight the future research lines in this domain, including defining multi-view agricultural datasets, combining transfer learning, adopting new data augmentation methods, and considering visualization and explanation issues. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Recently, deep learning methods have been rapidly developed in computer vision. To cope with these issues, we propose a dual-branch collaborative learning network for crop disease identification, called DBCLNet. Concretely, we propose a dual-branch collaborative module using convolutional kernels of different scales to extract global and local features of images, which can effectively utilize both global and local features. Meanwhile, we embed a channel attention mechanism in each branch module to refine the global and local features. Whereafter, we cascade multiple dual-branch collaborative modules to design a feature cascade module, which further learns features at more abstract levels via the multi-layer cascade design strategy. Extensive experiments on the Plant Village dataset demonstrated the best classification performance of our DBCLNet method compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the identification of 38 categories of crop diseases. Besides, the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-score of our DBCLNet for the identification of 38 categories of crop diseases are 99.89%, 99.97%, 99.67%, and 99.79%, respectively. 811 Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Sun, Zhou, Xie, Zhao, Liang and Zhuang.","channel attention; crop disease identification; deep learning; feature cascade; two-branch collaborative",

Although urban expansion results in population agglomeration and dramatic changes of land use, it also brings municipal water infrastructures to enhance the water quality of urban water bodies. In order to understand the relationship between water quality and urban expansion and water environmental management, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured, which were taken from 68 small urban water bodies in three distance bands (<5 km, 5–10 km and >10 km away from the city center of Changsha City, China) and four main water management types of protection, recovery, degradation and fisheries. The results showed that: 1) with increase in distance away from the city center, TN and TP concentrations in small water bodies and the percentage of polluted samples (IV ∼ inferior V) showed an increasing trend. 2) The degree of protection of small urban water bodies in the study area has not been synchronistic with urban expansion. The protected water bodies (long-term protected and recovering) are mainly distributed in the <5 km distance band, and anthropogenic disturbances (degraded water bodies and small water bodies used for fish farming) were mainly distributed in the 5–10 km and >10 km distance bands. Also, degraded and fish-managed water bodies had higher TN and TP contents than protected and recovering water bodies, but their TN:TP ratios were significantly lower. 3) Overall, urban expansion and water body management contributed 55.8% of the variance of TN and TP concentrations and TN:TP ratios in the study area. Water body management alone contributed 22.2%, which was higher than the contribution of urban expansion (7.6%). This shows that the insufficient application of water environmental protection measures has significantly changed the spatial distribution patterns of N and P concentrations and TN:TP ratios in urban small water bodies as the Changsha urban area has expanded. In the process of urban expansion, the simultaneous development of urban water ecological management is essential to ensure the health protection of the urban water environment.
